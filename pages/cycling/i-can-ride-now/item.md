---title: I can ride now!visible: true---6 weeks ago, I went to the Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga, ON for my checkup. I will never forget it because a pretty blonde X-Ray technician who looked about 23 said to me, "I gotta get those pants off". Of course, she handed me two gowns to put on. I wanted to reply that I suspected she said that to all the guys, I did not have the courage.

Today, I went for my last appointment to have the leg checked. This time, I wore track pants to avoid having to get changed. There must be some rule on this hospital that all X-Ray techs be young and good looking because today's X-Ray tech was a pretty brunette who could not have been more than 25. Maybe it's just me. Anyways, she took X-Rays of my leg and onto wait for my 30 sec briefing with the surgeon.

Before he came into the room, he congradulated me and offered that he hoped to never see me again. This was kind of like the time when 2.5 weeks after the crash on my way out of the hospital when the staples in my leg that held the incision together were to be removed and I asked him if it would hurt. He said, "It won't hurt me a bit, thanks for asking". Apparently, my bone in my leg has healed over and I have no restrictions. The surgeon re-iterated he never wanted to see me again, and we parted company. Hmmm....maybe the meeting only lasted 25 secs. Dunno.

So, I am whole again. Now, the physotherapist can teach me how to skip rope. I look forward to getting all the strength back in my leg and getting back to training in December. I want to race in the Easter weekend race in April. That means, I have a lot of work to do on strength, balance, and aerobic/anarobic capacity.

Hmmm....I'm considering testing myself this weekend and may do the Donut Ride.
