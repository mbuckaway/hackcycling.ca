---title: Are we elitists?visible: true---Anyone that has stepped foot into a "cycling shop" for the first time knows the feeling of entering something that approaching the alter at a church. It is something to be haled and perhaps aw-inspiring, never-mind somewhat scary. When you walk by bikes costing as much as a small car, one has to wonder if you are in the right place. Heaven forbid one ever brings in a department store bike in for repair. Laughter will usually ensue.

Cyclists are, um, an elite group. We have are own subculture. Where else but a group ride would someone notice your bike is dirty and point it out. Where else would you have to compare the wheel set or the shifters of the bike as if it makes a big difference (ok, so it does - if you ride long and fast, but I am biased, er, a cyclist).

To make the point, I discovered a good analogy on a recent posting of Cyclelicious comparing the cycling subculture to a supposed vacuum cleaner subculture. It makes you think:

"<span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; border-collapse: collapse;">He began his presentation talking about a mythical Vacuum Cleaner Culture, in which the people blog about their vacuums and obsess about the materials, design and construction of vacuum cleaners. Different vacuums are used for various vacuuming conditions. They recommend the right clothing, shoes, hats, gloves and underwear to use while vacuuming."</span>

Methinks the above sums up the subculture quite well. In parts of Europe, a bike is a mode of transportation. In North American, it's something one does must like golf.

The article also references a good video to make the point: <a href="http://53x11.com/blog/2008/11/05/We-Are-the-Cyclists.159" target="_blank" title="We are cyclists">CLICK HERE</a>

So, pardon me whilst I return to my Giant TCR Advanced SL1, with full 12.5lbs carbon frame, Durace 7900 group, Mavic wheels, Michelin Pro tires, PowerTap SL1, Garmin 705, etc, etc. Heaven forbid I have ride a bike without clipless pedals.
