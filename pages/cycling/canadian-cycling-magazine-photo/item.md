---title: Canadian Cycling Magazine Photovisible: true---<div>
  On Thursday, November 17, I attended the Morning Glory Club party. On the table was located a <a title="Canadian Cycling" href="http://cyclingmagazine.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Cycling</a> magazine. The club was featured in the magazine and my photo of the club appeared highlighting the MG Club. What I did not expect was what appeared on pages 12/13: a full two page photo of me leading out the pack on the Centurion C25 (25 miler) race in Blue Mountain back in September. Thanks for local photographer Marc Landry of <a title="Fast Time Productions" href="http://www.fasttimesinc.com/" target="_blank">Fast Time Productions</a> for capturing that shot.&nbsp;<br /><br /><img style="display: block; vertical-align: middle; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;" alt="MLandry Centurion C25 Sept 2011" src="images/photos/MLandry_Centurion_BMR-110917-00149.jpg" width="500" height="335" /><br /><br />For whatever reason that day, I decided the <a title="Centurion Cycling" href="http://centurioncycling.com/" target="_blank">Centurion</a> C25 race was going to be a 40km time trial and I came prepared with my D'Ornellas TT kit and my Scott TT bike. I even wore my fancy TT helmet. After the race was 1/2 way over, I regretted my bike choice - I did not think any strong riders would bother with such a short race - but I was wrong. It was a road race. I still rode off the front of the pack for most of it. By the time we got 3/4 of the way done, there were only some 10 riders left on my tail. Then, as I rounded a corner; I flatted. The photo is right before I blew the tire. I lost 15 mins to that and it would have been more, if it were not for a fellow MG club rider, Dave McKay, that happened to be going to a ride that morning in the area. Oddly, right before I flatted, the photo that appears in the Canadian Cycling Magazine was snapped. I would like to think I would have been on the podium had I not flatted.<br /><br />When I saw the photo, I contacted Canadian Cycling and asked how to get a copy. They put me in touch with Marc Landry and I collected my 11x14 print today. It hangs on my wall at home. Check Marc out of you are looking for any sports photography.
