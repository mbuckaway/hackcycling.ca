---title: Hitting the pavement at 40km/hvisible: true---On June 23, I was racing in the Midweek Bike club crit. It was a training race and we were practicing team sprints. It was my turn to sprint to the finish. My lead out man ran me as close to the line as he could. I stood up on the bike, jumped on the pedals, and went for the line. During the process, someone came across in front of me and I could see my front wheel hitting his back wheel. The next thing I knew, I was on the ground with everyone saying "DO NOT GET UP".

From what I was told, I must have hit the brakes. Something obviously happened because the damage to the bike showed the front brakes locked because the bolt holding the front brake calipers on was bent. Anyways, I apparently went over the handlebars and I can remember being some 2-3m in front of my bike. My bike computer suggested I was travelling at 40km/h at the time of the crash.

Today, I returned to the hospital for another set of XRays. I have a plate and screws in my leg. I managed to get the XRays on CDROM. The before and after shots are shown below.
