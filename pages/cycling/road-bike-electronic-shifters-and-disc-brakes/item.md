---title: Road bike: electronic shifters and disc brakesvisible: true---There are two things missing on road bikes produced today: electronic shifters and disc brakes. Shimano introduced the Di2 shifters and one can bike them on almost any high end road bike. If it were not for the need for more than one bike and an endless supply of funds, I would have a bike with the Di2 group on it. The second thing missing is disc brakes. They work regardless of the weather, don't require special pads for carbon rims, and stop much faster than rim brakes. While the UCI may not yet allow them, for amateur races, this really isn't much of a concern. There is hope. Just this year, the UCI permitted disc brakes on Cross bikes.

However, there are a few manufacturers that are experimenting with road bike technologies for those with money to burn (which most masters level racers do). FACTOR001 has created the ultimate road bike with both thing items from my wish list: electronic shifters and disc brakes.

Obviously, with carbon tubular wheels, Di2 groupo, disc brakes, etc. this is the Lamborghini of the bike world. I have no idea of the price, but I would expect $20-30K USD. I would sell my car, but it's only worth $8K used.
