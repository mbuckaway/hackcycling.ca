---title: The hardest part of racingvisible: true---<div>
  Back in August, I was still doing weekly time trials. As I had done for the months or so, I work from home so I can get to the TT with enough time to do a good warmup. The usualy day starts the same where I am usually quite enthused about doing the TT; however, that is in the morning hours. As the day roles on and I contemplate what I have to do to get the TT on time, my enthusiam subsides. By the time 4pm roles around for a 7pm TT, I am in full excuse mode. I am looking for excuses not to go. That night in August, I was praying for rain. If it rained, I would not go. Oddly, this is my experience for most races I've done this year. I have found I enjoy the trill of the race, assuming I make it to the start line. Getting to the start line, well, that is another matter.
