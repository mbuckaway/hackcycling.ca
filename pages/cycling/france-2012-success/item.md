---title: France 2012: Successvisible: true---<div>
  It's been a week or so since returning from France. I took a group to the town of Limoux in the Aude region in the south of France, in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains. We left Toronto on July 6 and arrived on July 7. We flew into Toulouse and we picked up by our host. From Toulouse it was a 1.5 hr drive into Limoux. For me, it was a return trip because I went to the same area the year prior.&nbsp;<br /><br />We stayed in rented houses in the town center - both were walking distance from the town square. The rides were almost always epic. Limoux is in a river valley and there are no flat roads. Everything is a climb or a descent. For example, we did the <a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/13563871" title="10 Hills Ride on Strava" target="_blank">10 Hills Ride</a> and well, it ended up being only a 9 hills ride because the group was done by the 9th hill. The last hill of this ride is the Limoux wall: 800m long and 14% average grade, kicking up to 20% in spots.<br /><br />We did two supported rides. We hired a van and driver to escort us around. Limoux was the start town of <a href="http://app.strava.com/rides/13282455" title="stage 14 of the Tour de France on Strava" target="_blank">stage 14 of the Tour de France</a>. The stage was 191km long and finished in Foix and some 2500m of climbing. The kicks on this course was a 6km section that hit 18% in parts. We had some 10 people on this ride (photo below) and almost all rode the whole thing. Four people put in an extra effort and rode back to Limoux for Foix for a 260km day.<br /><br /><img src="images/photos/Stage14_ride.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Stage14 ride" title="Tour de France stage 14 Ride" style="margin: 5px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;" />&nbsp;<br /><br />The second supported ride was one to the sea. We left Limoux for a 104km ride to the Lucate on the Mediterrain sea.<br /><img src="images/photos/col_de_pailheres.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="col de_pailheres" title="Col de Pairhere" style="margin: 5px; border-width: 2px; border-style: solid;" />&nbsp;
