---title: Paris-Ancaster Race: Resultsvisible: true---Sunday, April 18 was the day I did the Paris-Ancaster off/onroad race on my Cross bike with Don't Stop Jim. The best way I can describe the experience is educational. It was similar to the first time doing the Midweek Tuesday Night Crit. For that race, it was 24 laps (about 40 mins) of going as hard as I could. By the end of that crit, my lungs burned. It was at the end of that race where I learned how much I didn't know about racing.

This weekend started with a trip to Ancaster on Saturday to pickup the tags for Don't Stop Jim and I, and to ride the pre-ride for the race. I wanted to get to know some of the course. When I got to Ancaster, I picked up my tag and immediately upgraded to Wave 1 from Wave 2. I've done the donut ride and kept up, no problem, so how hard could a race that allows Unicycles and Tandem's be? Wave 1 is where the fast guys go. Oh boy. Assuming I was one of the fast guys was a mistake and it become apparently on the pre-ride. I should have known better; but I have a male ego and a need to learn things the hard way. 60kms in 3 hrs? How hard could that be?

The pre-ride took us to some of the "tough" off road parts of the course. Tough for someone that has only riden a cross bike offroad once before. We did the mud slide and some other parts of the end of the course. I had the Woman's British National Champion, Helen Wyman, instructing me how to properly ride a cross bike down hill on single track trails. The pre-ride started out hard because not only was the British National Champ along for the ride so were some of the Team Canada members. They hit some of the hills and barroled down them. I am glad I did the pre-ride. I knew when the end of the course was coming up during the race and what obsticals were ahead. The pre-ride also showed me I was completely out of my league.

Race Day. Jim and I met in Ancaster to upgrade his tag to Wave 1. His wife drove up and the bikes to Paris to the start line. I dressed in arm and leg warmers so I wouldn't be overheating during the race but I was a bit cold for the start. Jim and I went for a 10km ride for about 30 mins to warm up. A few racers were on trainers in the parking lot. We went to the corral and lined up for the start. I'll never forgot the start. The horn went off and I tried to get on my bike. Some guy beside me said "Ah, a roadie with no cross experience".&nbsp; Riders were passing me...but I got onto the pavement and hammered it up the hill. The field was also well up the road. We hit the first bit of rail trail. I was unprepared for riding full-on race pace on gravel. Riders were passing on the left, ride, and down the center. I hit zone 4 heart rate and stayed there for the 20-30 mins were riding on the rail trail. I saw Jim up ahead doing his own ride. We then hit a hill of very loose gravel. Almost everyone got off the run up. A lot of the mountain bikers just road up. That was the last I saw of Jim. I had to run up the hill the entire way because I just couldn't get traction. When I got the top the field had split out. The fast guys were gone. There was some farmers fields and single track on the ride. Nothing hard, but grinding up offroad trails at 50-60rpm is hard work.

At some point, we landed on a peice of road and I reach back for a banana, and got a handfull of mush. Two banana s- my food for the ride - were useless. I only had one gel and some gummy bears. So, while running out of gas, I had no fuel. Just a camel back of fluid. We got stopped at a road crossing and I consumed the gel. I did fine on the road and managed to draft others and lead packs. In most cases, when I got up to speed, I would be passing other riders (especially the mountain bikers) without difficulty. The offroad parts, especially farmers fields, were hard. I managed to NOT miss a cow patty on one of the them. Off road, it felt like I was going backwards. Everyone was passing...and I let them, moving out of the way without slowing down as I could. I was running on empty when we hit farmers field and volunteers were handing out bananas. GOOD! I grabbed two. Ate one and stuff the other in my back pocket. I should have grabbed three.

The rest of the race was uneventful. I got slower as the ride went on because I just didn't have the energy. Near end of the race on the last bits of road I was having trouble getting up hills. I was happy to start seeing peices of trail and road I had seen on Sat. because that meant the end of the race was near. Peices of trail I took my time on Sat. were travelled at near speed during the race. Adrenellin was pumping and I was moving. We hit the mud slide and I fell of once. This is the only time I fell off the bike. I saw others do endos and such as they tried to navigate the mud. There is nothing like carrying a 20lbs bike through ankle deep mud. I recall seeing the final hill...the hill I managed almost get up the day before, and there was just no stream left to make it. I walked most of the way up until near the top someone screamed "GET BACK ON YOUR BIKE", so I did and rode the rest of the way up the final hill standing on the pedals.

I passed the finish line at 2:42:29. I met Jim who said he did it in 2:24:00. Not bad for someone that wanted it done in 3:10:00. I beat the 3hr average so I wasn't too disappointed. It was a learning experience.

202th in my age category. 565th overall of 1272 riders. Not bad. Not good. But, bad for someone whose second experience on a cross bike was a race.

From the race, I take away:

1) Ride with enough gels to make it through the race and fuel up every 20 mins. Race pace is hard and the body needs the energy.

2) Have some kind of backup fuel. Never know if/when something will get lost. Can't finish a race in good time riding on empty.

3) Cross skills are required. I'm going the Learn to Cross in the fall. I need to be able to get on and off the bike fast and be able to handle the bike better. This was a major factor on my finish time.

4) Camel backs are great for real off road, but smash anything in the back pockets. Need two water bottles for this race. The rail trail and road portions are where hydration will happen anyways. Water bottles are fill easily at water stations. Camel backs take too much time to deal with.

5) Do the pre-ride on Sat before and spend the day practicing some of the course.

Was it fun? No. It was work. But I look at it as a educational experience. Something to be improved on next year.
