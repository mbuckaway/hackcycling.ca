---title: Listserv Created! Come ride with us!visible: true---There are a few google groups out there for those wanting to ride the wee hours of the morning in and around Toronto. They work well and they have garnished quite a folliowing. I would like to start a simular group for riding the Collingwood, Creemore, and Blue Mountain areas. There are hills out there!

Thus, I have created a listserv allowing others to join the mailing list and connect with others of a simular interest. I had setup a google group, but would rather brand the group under the Hackcycling name; hence, the list serv.

Check it out and join the group: <a target="_blank" title="Collingwood Rides mailing list" href="http://lists.hackcycling.ca/mailman/admin/collingwood-rides">http://lists.hackcycling.ca/mailman/admin/collingwood-rides</a>

While anyone can join, you should have experience riding with a group and be able to keep a speed of 28km/h on the flats, otherwise, you list either getting dropped or annoying others on the rides. However, if enough "slower" riders join, we can go out in two groups. The mailing list has been setup for help everyone connect and setup rides. Come spring, I will hold regular rides through the group much like the Begal Ride or Morning Glory ride here in Toronto.

This past weekend we were out on our cross bikes riding the hills of the back roads of Creemore. Lots of mud and fun.
