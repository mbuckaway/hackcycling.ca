---title: Flu "Pandemic"?visible: true---<span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Yesterday, I went into the office. Not a hour after being there did the sneezing start and then later in the day, the nose decided to do more cardio than I've done in three months (ie. nose was running). <br /> </span>

Fast forward to the evening; when watching Lie to Me, an ad from our Gov't came on warning us of the pandemic and suggest we:

- use hand sanitizer   
- disinfect surfaces   
- sneeze into our sleeve.

Can the people that created the commercial really be that stupid? The flu is a virus which is not affect by bacterial agents (disinfectants). Sneezing regardless of how one covers up, would eject the flu virus (assuming one is around during the contagious stage), into the air. Sleeve or hand - why does it matter? You are passing the virus to someone else regardless - I suppose the sneeze lowers the risk of contagion, but still....

The commercials are a waste of tax payers money...and are spending false information. They are not raising awareness, but spreading panic.
