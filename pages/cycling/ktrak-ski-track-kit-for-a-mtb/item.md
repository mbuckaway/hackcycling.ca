---title: KTrak Ski Track Kit for a MTBvisible: true---I don't like mountain biking. The last time I tried riding with some MTB bikers, I was bored. Too much stop and go...although, when they go, they go hard. So, I don't have a mountain bike. I now I found a reason to get one. The KTrak Ski Track conversion kit seems like the neetest thing I've seen for a bike. One remove the wheels, puts a ski on the front fork, and replaces the back wheel with a special track wheel. Then, you ride the bike, like a snowmobile, outside in the deep snow. This looks like fun.

Check out the company's website: <a target="_blank" title="KTrak Ski Bike" href="http://www.ktrakcycle.com/">KTrak</a>

Here is a older video of someone riding the bike:
