---title: Remember Rule #9? Weekly Crit Cancelledvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  This weeks Midweek Crit in Mississuaga, ON is cancelled, folks. No racing in the rain practice tonight. I'm kind of miffed at having the night off because I was looking forward to practicing racing in the rain. I wanted to kill it this evening. I'm not blaming the Midweek CC staff; however, with last weeks poor turn out, I don't blame them.

  Just as an FYI, last Thursday in Buffalo, the Buffalo CC had 30 racers out in the B race and 40 racers out in the A race racing in the POURING rain for the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.buffalobicycling.com/racing.php?type=2&series=12" title="Larkinville Challenge" target="_blank">Larkinville Challenge</a>. Yes, downpour. Everyone kept the rubber on the road. Breakaways happened in both races. These guys took advantage of the conditions and forced the pace to extreme proporitions on the first lap in the B race. Three guys got a 30 sec lead on the pack 10 laps into the race.&nbsp;

  At Midweek on Tuesday night, everyone ran for cover at the hint of rain and there ended up being only nine guys in the B race and 20 in the A race. While I was somewhat pleased to be in the top ten for a change, I was disappointed in the bad turn out. I saw too many guys return to their cars. WTF?

  In my mind, you can't learn to race in the rain riding the trainer and watching it on TV. You have to do it. You have to experience the spray in your face, deal with getting soaked through, the brakes fading on the carbon rims, wonder if you'll slip out on a corner, feel the tires lose grip as you sprint out of corner a little too hard, etc.. I raced twice in the rain last week and once in April in Roswell, GA. Each time I got a bit more confident.

  I guess, I am a bit peeved out American friends seem to fill the racing roster and we Canucks can not.
