---title: Matthew rides the velodromevisible: true---The last weekend in December marked the first time of the season that there was enough snow on the ground for cross country skiing at Hardwood Ski and Bike to happen. So, I decided to go skiing. Oddly enough, my 17 year old son, Matthew, decided he wanted to give it a shot. For the record, it was his idea and he asked to go. So, I took him. He did the 5km trail failing over himself much like his Dad did the year prior. 5km and he had enough. I know the feeling. If you can't stand on the skis and fall everywhere when you go down a hill, it is not much fun. It took me lots of practice to get to the point where I can go around the trails and slide down the hills without a concern. So, for me, skiing this year was fun.

As for the track, I'm progressing. Last Thursday, I did a 10.9 sec flying lap which saw a speed of 45.5km/h. No bad but not great. On Saturday, the fastest flying lap at the track races was 8.3 secs for 57km/h. Thus, I figure I need to pull a 9 sec lap to be able to race competitively.

But, I digress. My son Matthew while driving bad from the ski club asked if he can ride the track. At the time, I brushed off the notion because he has never riden a road bike. Plus, when I took him for a 10km ride in the summer, he made it about 3 km and turned around and went back home. He also couldn't go faster then 15km/h. The track requires the rider maintain a speed of a minumim of 28km/h - 32km/h is best, to make it around the corners. But, after some thought, I contacted Rob Good at the track and thought Matthew might be able to ride the Velokids session. They take kids when are just learning to ride bikes and help them learn to ride the track. So, Saturday, I took Matthew with me.

After the rec ride session in the morning, Rob suggested Matthew join in with the track 1 course. It was about 30 mins into the session when Matthew got his bike setup. So, he worked on bike handling by trying to pickup bottles filled with water and put them down again. As Matthew progressed and got used to the fixie, Rob got him up on the track and he did a few laps whilst everyone else was listening to instructions. Matthew got good enough to be able to ride for a bit during the Skills and Drills session, but clearly still had a lot to learn. Having never riden a road bike in a group, he had not idea how to hold his line and swung wildly from the black to the red and occationally to the blue line. He still has to learn how to properly get on and off the track. However, he became quite good at riding the fixie. Starting and stopping weren't much of an issue. Magically, Matthew wants to do it again. I would like to see him learn how to hold his line so he can safely to the rec sessions when I go.

Anyways, during the session I pulled out my Blackberry and caught this photo and video:
