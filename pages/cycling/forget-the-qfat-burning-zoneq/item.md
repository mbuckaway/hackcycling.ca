---title: Forget the "Fat Burning Zone"visible: true---I read the blog of Alex Poole. He is an atheltic coach in the UK and has studied health science in relation to exercise and fitness. He usually has some good posts on various factors affecting performance in exercise.

Today's post is related to the notion that I read about some time back elsewhere: forget about the fat burning zone on the cardio machines. In a nutshell, if you were to jog an hour on the treadmill in the "fat burning zone" you might burner 280 calories of fat of say the 400 calories burned during that hour. However, if you were to run full tilt for a hour and burn 1200 calories, you would end up burning 360 calories of fat. Which is better?
