Who: Anyone that has group riding experience using double pacelines and can hold 30km/h on the flats. Ride pace should be able 28-31km/h average for the time we are moving. This is not a race, but a steady pace ride to preview the course. We will ride in group formation until descending hills. A 11-28 cassette or compact chainring is highly recommended.  
Ride time: 5-6hours. (last year, the ride took 5hr30).

Please confirm your attendance by emailing me (mark at buckaway dot ca). While you don't have to let me know you are coming, I want to gauge numbers. I may ask someone to drive support for the ride and we would like to know how much snack/water to buy.

We will stop in Creemore at my friend Ed's place at 222 Mill St. as we did last year. We will also stop in Eugene. We will wait for limited about of time on the hill tops for slower riders; however, we may asking slower riders to form a group with anyone going short. We will wait for anyone with mechanicals. If a faster group forms, so be it - I won't be riding with you. I intend to ride with the main pack. The idea is everyone should be riding with other riders. No one should be riding alone (it's no fun). Make sure you bring enough water/snacks on board to go the distance between stops because they are farther apart than the actual gran fondo. Everyone is responsible for everyone else.
