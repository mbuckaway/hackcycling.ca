---title: Crud Road Racer Fendersvisible: true---Riding outside in the fall means water on the road. Yesterday, the dew made the road damp. Two weeks ago, we ran by a construction site which made the road wet (and muddy). I have also riden in near rainy conditions. When the road is wet and one is riding in a group, it is hard to tell if it is actually raining, because of the spray from the wheel of the rider in front of you. In some clubs in wet climates, one is not permitted to ride without fenders. There are times I wish I had them to keep the dirt off my back.

Enter <a title="Road Racer" href="http://www.crudproducts.com/products/roadracer" target="_blank">Crud's RoadRacer</a> fenders. These are lightweight plastic fenders that attach to a road bike with 23mm or 25 mm tires and cover most of the tire. I've seen other riders with metal felters, but they look cumbersome to attach. The Crud Roadrace attachs with no tools using rubber bands (the same ones used to hold on speed sensors or lights) and thumbscrews. They look easy to use.

<a title="ProBikekit Roadracer fenders" href="http://www.probikekit.com/display.php?code=A0551" target="_blank">ProbikeKit </a>in the UK also offers them for about $38CND with free postage to Canada. It seems like a good deal. I ordered mine. We will see how then turn out.
