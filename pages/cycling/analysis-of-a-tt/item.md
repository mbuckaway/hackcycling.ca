---title: Analysis of a TTvisible: true---In August, I did my first time trial. The TT was part of my bike club championships. Before that day, I never did a TT before. I have done some sustain 20min power zone 4 efforts on the trainer, but never out on the road. The course was laid out on a 15km loop around a section of northern Toronto. I can remember the start of the ride being very hard. I had warmed up sufficiently, but cooled down waiting for my turn. I was in something like fifth last position. It felt like I had to warm up on the course all over again but I soon got into the rhythm and did the 15km. Ride time was something like 23:46 for a average speed of 38.4km/h. Apparently, for a guy on a road bike this speed was very good. I came in seventh overall from the club members present. The top six finishers all have proper TT bikes and outfits.

After the ride, I reviewed the ride data. I used my Garmin to track the ride. I was shocked to see the average power for the ride was around 290W. I don't think I have ever sustained that power before for that long. The book "Training and Racing with a Powermeter, by Andrew Coggan & Hunter Allen, VeloPress, 2005" is useful for analysing this ride. The 
<a target="_blank" title="Power Table" href="http://www.truesport.com/Bike/2007/articles/druber/druber15.html">power table for TT</a>&nbsp;in the book shows my ride to be in the CAT3 category for the whole and 20min efforts, but I quickly go downhill from there. At the time, I weighed in at 79kg. So, if I divid my power numbers by my weight, I get a power to weight ratio for each of the times:

5sec: 635W - 8.03W/kg

1min: 408W - 5.16W/kg

5min: 308W - 3.89W/kg

20min: 289W - 3.65W/kg

Full: 290W - 3.67W/kg

The ride data &nbsp;is located <a href="http://tpks.ws/HVjprwfV" title="Training Peaks Ride Data for TT" target="_blank">HERE</a> if you are interested.

So, for the entire ride and 20min efforts I am in the CAT3 range, but move to the untrained range when it does to the shorter efforts. I am not surprised by these numbers. For the most part it shows my inexperience riding a TT. I stood on the pedals on the hills and recovered on the downhills which are two things roadies do that one does not do in a TT (apparently). I also know from my experience this season, that I can not sprint to save my life (well, I have outrode a dog once). I just can't seem to get the pedals around fast enough; although, I can sit and spin for a long effort without much difficulty. &nbsp;

Granted, this is only my second year of taking cycling seriously and I crashed out last season. So, I had to rebuilt my fitness from scratch this year as well as last year. Next year, I should do better. I will be starting with a higher fitness level at the beginning of the season and I will have some experience under my belt from which to build. I am looking forward to getting a TT bike and doing the club TT's on a weekly basis. Next year, I should be faster and produce better power numbers.
