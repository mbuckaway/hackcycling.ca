---title: Foods high in Fat and Sugar equivalent to Cocainevisible: true---There is a say that say "Research has been shown to cause cancer in rats". In reading "<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/End-Overeating-Insatiable-American-Appetite/dp/0771095538/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1264528528&sr=1-1" target="_blank">The End of Overeating</a>" by David Kessler, I came across an interesting comparison.

Sara Ward of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill has done research with rats where she feed them varying degrees of a corn oil solution and determined the amount of work they would do to get the solution. Add sugar to the fat solution and the rats would work harder still.

Here is a quote from Kessler's book (pg. 31):

"This is scientific confirmation that the combinaton of far and sugar is a strong reinforcer. In a conversation with Ward, I asked her how strong it really was. The break point at which the animals no longer work for the reward [of sugar/fat solution], she told me, is slightly lower than the breaking point for cocaine. Animals are willing to work almost as hard work either one."

While this is a set of studies done on rats, the correlation to us humans is usually fairly high. This makes it fairly clear than all engineered foods aka processed foods are made to taste good so you will buy more. The food companies know you can't resist high fat, high sugar, or high fat/sugar foods. The usual response to anyone sucking back a large Dairy Queen treat&nbsp; at 700cals+ is "it tastes good".&nbsp; Same goes for a Double Capachino Mocha Fapachinno Latte Extra whip from Starbucks or Second Cup (or from the office coffee machine). Eat. Spend money. Make the food execs pockets and your waist line fatter.

Want to lose weight? Condition yourself to eat better. Carrots, apples, etc. as snacks. 50% of your plate at meals should be vegetables. Maintaining and losing weight requires livestyle changes, because there are tons of temping and tasty "foods" out there they we should be avoiding. Of course, avoiding them can be very hard.

Of course, I've managed to stay from cocaine and other drugs my entire life, some of you many not have been so "lucky".
