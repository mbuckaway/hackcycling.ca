---title: Hong Fu Track Bike Buildvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  This is a project I started back in September. With the annoucement of the six day race last summer at the Forest City Velodrome, I decided it was time to upgrade the track bike. I originally bought my Fuji Track 2 with the idea of saving using the rental bikes at the track. I had no idea it would be almost three years later and I would be racing the track and loving it. So, I set out on a quest for a carbon track bike with a powertap. Today, I have almost completed the build with the arrival of the carbon frame from Hong Fu Bikes in China on Monday. The only thing currently missing from the build is the FSA Carbon Track cranks. I will get them next month.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The bike has the following components:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - 54cm Hong Fu FM126 12K Gloss finish track frame and fork ($500US)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - Chinese rims (I forget from who), 28 spoke, external nipples, 3K weeve, matt finish, tubulars ($280US)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - Phil Wood Hi Flange 28 spoke front hub ($200US)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - PowerTap Pro 28 spoke rear hub ($1000CAN)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - Adomo Road Seat ($150CAN)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  -&nbsp;3T Sphinx Ltd Carbon Track Bars (unfortunately, these are not legal for UCI sanctioned races) ($225CAN)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - FSA Cranks (from the old track bike)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - Speedplay Pedals (from old track bike)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - Vittoria Pista EVO CS track tubulars ($110CAN ea)
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So, for around $2500, I have a carbon track bike. Add the FSA carbon cranks for $300US and a new BB ($40) and it's around $2800. The best track bikes made by Look start at $12K just for the frame.

  Today is going to be a fun day. I am driving out to the track to try out the bike.
