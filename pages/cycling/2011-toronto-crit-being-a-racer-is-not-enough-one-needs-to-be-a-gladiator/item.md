  I received the following email this morning from Julian at Vitess. Personally, I love the title. I never throught of myself as a gladiator, but considering the amount of crashing at the Toronto Crit.

  <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;">Thinking that pushing, pulling and elbowing are reserved for the “bad boys” of the Pro Peloton? Think again. A festival of crashes in the Downtown Core of Toronto just over a week ago. Most of it on camera.</span>
</p>

<span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;">The key feature of this mini film is our favourite racer/cameraman Mark Buckaway saying hello to the officials at the start/finish line, at (very) close distance, his behind on the sidewalk. What you won’t see is that Chris Hull, our second Vitess Rider entered into this M3/S4 race ended up on the ground at the same crash. Broken wheel, carbon bar, bruises, road burns and all.</span>

<p class="MsoNormal">
  <span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: black;">While Mark was able to get up and re-enter the race, Chris had to pull out.</span>

Most of our UCI-licensed Vitess Riders have entered this race. A red/white/black podium in the making. Keep up the excellent work guys! Rubber down better. With a big shout out to one of our newest Vitess Rider: Jaime Saavedra – welcome on board Jaime! With one Kitchener-based win already a few weeks ago (Nith River), Jaime is a fantastic asset to our group of racers. His experience as a Pro of many years will certainly come handy when it comes to preparing and winning races.&nbsp; And while his buddies were busy in Italy and soon in France, he will make a mark in Ontario – a Vitess one. </span>
