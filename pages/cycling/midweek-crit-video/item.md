---title: MIdweek Crit Videovisible: true---I did the Midweek Crit on Tuesday. First race since I crashed last year. It was a test of my nerves and to see if I could do it. I did. It felt like doing the Donut Ride with all the Donut Riders present. The pace was about the same. I plan on doing the crit weekly.

Here is the video:
