---title: 46 Mins in Hellvisible: true---<div>
  First, the race was 40 mins long...but it took me 6:31 long than the leader to complete four laps of the course. Yes, I did my first Southern Cup cross race on Sunday, October 30 at Hardwood Ski and Bike. I am happy. I didn't finish last. Originally, I bought the cross bike in 2009 used to be used as a commuter bike. After a dismall result in Paris/Ancaster in 2010, I decided I needed to learn to actually ride the cross bike and did the Midweek Cross through the fall 2010. This fall, I returned to Midweek and found I was better at riding the course, but still quite the beginner. When I started cross back in September, I promised myself I would do one cross race. I picked the Hardwood Cross because I trained the course in September. However, it was still a hard effort.<br /><br /><img style="border-width: 1px; border-color: #000000; border-style: solid;" alt="IMG 5701" src="images/photos/IMG_5701.jpg" height="218" width="300" /><br />

  <br /><br />Cross, I say, is remarkably harder that road for two reasons: intensity and skill. Cross is intense. It's either a full on effort or your are coasting or skimming over a flat section. Climbing a 10% grade in dirt is harder than on a road. From my stats, I rode 44mins in zone 4. Zone 4 is also my time trial pace, but whereas in a time trial on can relax and get used to the effort, cross requires the rider to pay attention and tackle the varying terrain. Skill. Man, this is what killed me the most. While I pre-road the course that day because so I didn't look like a knob having to run up some of the course where run ups weren't intended, I still lost too much time so much time on the turns. Whereas the top guys wouldn't need brakes on most of the course, I was one them far too much. One never encounters the tight turns on a road course like one does in cross. So, without sufficient practice, cross can be quite humbling.<br /><br />So, I have done my one cross race for the season. I finished 19th of 25 M3 racers 6:31 behind the leader. I have now hung up the cross bike and will focus on the track. Next year, methinks I will give some effort to cross which I only ever&nbsp; considered a fun things to do...but getting dropped after the first lap is no fun. I need to fix that. I would like to see the finish of the race with the pack even be part of the finishing sprint, but that will require training on the cross bike starting in the summer.<br /><br />[My son came with me and took some photos <a target="_blank" title="PHotos from Hardwood Cross" href="http://photos.hackcycling.ca/hardwoodcross2011/">LINK HERE</a>. It was the first time he has seen a cross race. His comments: "That looks like fun". I may have another racer next year.]<br /><br />
