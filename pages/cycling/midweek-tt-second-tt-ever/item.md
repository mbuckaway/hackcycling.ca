---title: Midweek TT: Second TT evervisible: true---I took the new TT bike out for a spin today and did the MIdweek TT. I put on the fancy helmet, skin suit, shoe covers, and the whole shebang. It was "only" a 15km TT, but it hurt nethertheless. I had never riden the course before, but I managed to find my way around. I could have shaved some time by not sitting up on the corners and at the end, but I am happy to have done it. I spent the hour after the ride hacking up a lung because it has been quite some time since I did an all out effect like that. I need to do it more often.

Stats for the ride:

Average Power: 287W (garmin said 291W)

<hr id="system-readmore" />


Average HR: 157bpm (this value I find amazing because I usually give up when I hit a high heart rate for a long period of time).

Time: 23:20 (from the timers)

Speed: 38.4km/h (from my Garmin)

I should mention that there was something like a 30-40km/h headwind at the top of the ride for about the first 6km. So, I struggled to maintain even 28km/h and may have went out too hard. On the backstretch, I got up to over 50km/h but could have pushed harder. The stats show I was in just about every power zone including zone 1. I should have been on Zone 4 for the entire ride. But, I was in zone 4 heart rate for some 20 mins and managed zone 5 for some of the ride.

have yet to figure out how to do a warm up such that I don't end up warming up again on the course. The first 3km were hell until my lungs settled down into the effort.

Next week, I will be a bit more prepared. I need to ride with at least one water bottle on the bike for the warm ups. It is not like I will be drinking on the ride, but during the warmup I will be. I also will bring music and blast it in my ears to distract me; although, I have yet to figure where to put the thing in my skin suit. I had to find a place to put my key for my car. I will also try to put a bit hard and more evenly through the course. Albeit, not I know how to get there, where to park, etc. I will be able to get in a proper warm up.
