---title: Ride the Bruce Road Racevisible: true---<div>
  Today was race day. It was my second OCUP race and race I did at the Bike the Bruce race up in the Owen Sound area. I rode for Vitess under the Vitess Racing Club banner and there was one other official team mate present (Dr. Chris) and two other honorary team members: Jamie and Conrad.&nbsp;

  I could complain about the slow pace of the ride, but I have to remind myself I'm doing the M3 races to gain experience...and the pace of the ride really shouldn't matter until I can consistently finish in the top ten - something I have not yet achieved. I came with the expectation of racing will hurt, and I've not yet seen that but the season is far from over.

  So far, I've adopted a "finish with the pack" mentality, and it seems to be working. I finished 13th of the something like 35 riders in my category in this race and I finished 14th at the Springbank Crit. Experience in racing will no doubt will help team finish in the top three positions. It would be great to get to the point where we lead Dr. Chris (our sprinter) out for the sprint and have Vitess jerseys on all three podium spots.

  As for todays race, the wind was strong enough to cause the pack to ride at a group ride pace until the last 7km of the last lap. The wind was gusting to 60km/h at times. I did a pull at the front into the win, and I could see why the pack was going so slow: I didn't last more than 5 mins before my heart rate was near red line. &nbsp;At the 7km mark, attacks started to happen, and attack many did. However, with every attack, Dr. Chris and I managed to stay with them with a few times both of us coming out front. We finished the race with a bunch sprint and I got a chance to practice my TT ability to the finish line. While I didn't get out saddle, I held my pace and finished with the pack. Needless to say, I saw the first place winner win close up. The finish was tight. It was all about being in the right place at the ride time. I learned on the track that it is not the fastest person that wins a sprint, but it is the person that can outsmart the other racers. I saw that happen&nbsp;today. Position is everything. I hope at some point there is a hilltop finish. I would like to see the strongest survive.
