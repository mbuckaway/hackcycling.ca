---title: Niagara Classic Road Racevisible: true---<div>
  I have to admit to being somewhat apprehensious about this race. The Niagara Classic RR takes in Effingham hill. Yes, the little town at the base of the climb is actually called Effingham. Give the hill, it is appropriately named. On the recon of the course the day before, our Garmins indicated this hill hits 16% at the steepest section and stay there for about 100-150m. It's a hard climb regardless of how fast one rides it - do it at race pace, and it's an all out effort. On my recon I max'd my heart rate out each of the two times I tried it. I neglected to mention that the entire climb is about 2-3km long varying from 4-9% until the nasty 16% section. The climb is long enough that one cannot just jump out of the saddle and power up the hill.<br /><br /><img alt="Ian and I climbing Effingham Hill" src="http://www.sportszonephotography.ca/Cycling-2011/Niagra-Classic-RR/830-AM-Races/i-bDHKd38/0/M/Abby-014-M.jpg" width="400" /><br /><br />

  The race course itself is race easy - all flat, slightly downhill, or a fast decent with that one steep climb to get you back to the stop of the course. The M3 group on this race seemed to want to take it easy. The pace was slower than passed races; but I didn't care. Like everyone else, I expect, I anticipated the hill would take some recovery time and kept the pace low. There were a few attacks, but they never really amounted to anything and not one got away. It helped (?) that the KOM's were canceled. I am sure the pace would have been higher if that were not the case. Only on the back side of the course did the pace pickup and the people at the front jossled for position for the fast decent. I learned on the first lap that best place to be was near the front. I stayed off the front for most of the race, because I wanted to save myself for the climb. There was always a willing party to sit on the front and tow the entire pack along. On lap three someone jumped off the front just before the descent, and me and one other responded. I questioned my following because it spiked my heart rate and I knew the climb to come would hurt if I wasn't sufficiently recovered. 
  <br /><br />Laps 2, 3, and 4 I was usually in the top ten to the top of the climb which made me happy. I knew if I stayed near the front I would be in a good position for a top ten finish...and I did that. On the last lap, I was about the second or third rider to the base of the steep part of the hill. Unfortunately, the hill took it's toll on the previous laps because I wasn't able to stay out&nbsp; of the saddle for the entire climb. I saw Jamie from the team leap past me and I screwed at him to go, go. Near the top I found some energy and slammed the pedals around to pass one or two riders. I placed 10th overall. I couldn't believe I managed to finish in the top ten in a race were the climbing well was part of the race. I'm happy with the result. It was the best OCUP race yet this year.
