---title: Not Winning to Winvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  I am always amazed that when I get feedback on a blog post. Not so much anymore that people actually read some of the stuff I write. I endevour to post things I learn along the way. There is some 4+ years of archives on this site, and I sometimes go back and read some the old stuff to see how far I have come, and to remind myself how far I have yet to go (and how much I can't seem to be able to proofread).

<p style="text-align: left;">
  This week I got feedback on my last post. Scott, at the track, sent me an email with a Youtube video from a TEDx of&nbsp;Natalie Dell O'Brien, an Olympic rowing Bronze medal winner on losing and how it adds perspective to training. I know all about losing. I do it enough. When I watched the video two thinks came to mind: something Ed Veal repeated during indoor training this winter and&nbsp;<span style="text-align: left;">what happened at the Good Friday Road Race.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="text-align: left;">Ed, a two time Provincial Road champion, told us over and over again about how many races he lost. Sometimes you don't have it on the day or you make some mistakes in the race that cost the win. Secondly, I made some critical mistakes and completely underestimated the race in Ancaster, ON. Those mistake got me angry at myself in a way that drove me to consider what I did and how it was never going to happen again. The point being, the bad result fuelled my desire to push on and to learn from the experience rather than be upset about it.</span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="text-align: left;">So on that note, I offer the video on Losing to add perspective to your training.</span>
