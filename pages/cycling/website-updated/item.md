---title: Website Updatedvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  It has been able two months since I paid any attention to my website/blog. I signed up for a course at York University in Sept and spend the next 3.5 months either working, studying, or training. I didn't have much time to do much of anything else. In fact, there were numerous times, I put training asside to study. December saw me get back on the horse, so to speak, and get back to training. During the holiday break, I attended the Forest City Velodrome training camp and achieved some personal bests. If you haven't already seen them, I've produced three videos in December. Two from the Forest City Velodrome and one training video on how to get up to 200RPM. Please check out <a href="http://videos.hackcycling.ca">http://videos.hackcycling.ca</a>&nbsp;or click on the Videos link in the menu system. Today, I decided to give the website an overhaul. It's been needing it for a while. The following changes have been done (which you may or may not care about):
</p>

<li style="text-align: left;">
  upgrade to Joomla 2.5 which is the current production release
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  update the photos in the banner. They are 2012 photos.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  cleaned up the menu system
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  added a real comments system powered by Disqus. Yes, you can comment on my blog posts and I will get a notification that you did so I can approve them in a timely fashion. Comments have been a sore spot for this blog for years - nothing really worked. I think this one will.
</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">
  added a Facebook like as well as Twitter.
</li>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  So, please put comments on my posts. Please share the posts everyone. I should also note: I post alot of cycling related info to Twitter. Please follow me if you are interested in keeping up to date. I save the blog for longer essay style articles...and I have few rolling around in my head to type out this month.
