---title: Donut Ride Sunday, June 27visible: true---I managed to make a video from the Donut Ride from Sunday. Instead of looking for perfection and getting titles to introduce the shots and put telemetry over the video from my Garmin, I choose the check hack route and stuffed the clips together and uploaded the video.

I should note this ride is the first time I managed to make it through the hills to 17th sideroad. The Vitess bike helped.
