---title: Going Longvisible: true---Going long. That is the goal this year. Because of my crash last year, I delayed starting to get into racing "hard" until next year. I just wasn't able to start training soon enough this year to be in race shape soon enough to matter. So, this weekend was the first attempt at going long.

Saturday, I put on about 180km. I rode for about a hour because the club ride (30km), did the hammerfest of a club ride (90km), and than managed another 60km after the club ride (I didn't actually intend to go that long - bad planning).

Today, I planned with Camera guy Jay, a century ride. 160km from my place to Zepher, up to Lake Simcoe and home down Warden. The plan was to put the miles on and no worry too much about the pace. There were only two of us, so we rode how we felt at any given moment. My only regret is I did not know the route in advance. While it was planned out on mapmyride.com, it is hard to know where the stops are and how to plan to eat along the way. I think I overdid the food part on the ride. Yesterday, I got home and was ready for the recovery meal. Today, I didn't need it.

I should explain. I went with two bananas, four cliff bars, a flask of hammergel, and two water bottles. We stopped in Zepher at a corner stop. I got a can of coke (the only time I consume pop is on a ride), a chocolate bar (ok, that wasn't necessary), a muffin, and a bottle of water (water bottle refill). This was at the 70km mark. I grabbed all this stuff.
