---title: Mastershift workoutsvisible: true---Nissan has put together a web site feature four "Masters" in their sports. They are Chris Carmicheal, master cyclist and coach to Lance Armstrong, Tara Stiles, master Yoga instructor, Ryan Hall master marathon runner, and Eddie George a top American football player. Each of these masters presents a series of videos for free on working out and excelling in their sport. It's worthwhile to checkout because most of the videos of this type are only available if you pay for them. Nissan makes them available for free.

While all are good, I found the videos from Chris Carmicheal and Tara Stiles of the most interest to me as a cyclist.
