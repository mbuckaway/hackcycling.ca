---title: It's not that cold out....brrrrr.visible: true---Today, I decided to try out the winter gear. I picked up a new jersey and some heavy mits over the last week. Now that there was snow on the ground, I decided to go for a short run. The goal is to do the donut ride in the dead of winter. The ride was to the physio office and back. All total, I rode for about 15-20 mins on the cross bike. The idea was to gauge how warm I would be.

Here is the result:

Given the ride was to head to the physio office, I didn't put on the bike shorts and heavy tights. For the few minutes I was outside, it didn't matter. I just wanted to try out the other winter gear. However, I was out long enough to realize that the light wind prove jersey was not entirely windproof. My face froze in the wind, so some kind of face covering would be a good idea.

For the next ride, I would like to find a med to heavy windproof jersey and cycling boots. But we'll have to see how the budget goes.
