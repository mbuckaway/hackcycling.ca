---title: Donut Ride Nov 21 Videovisible: true---The weather was supposed to be 4C and sunny two weeks ago. I looked at the weather and saw -3C on the Weather Network page and decided to overdress. I figured it would warm up and I could strip off some layers. Well, that didn't happen. I got a bit colder. Apparently, the windchill went down to -7C. I noticed snow at the start of the ride, but it really started to snow midride at Grandma's Oven. On the Donut Ride, anything goes. We ride regardless of the weather.
