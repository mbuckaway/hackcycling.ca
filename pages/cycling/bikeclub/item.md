  The D'Ornella's Bike Club better know as the D'Ornella's Racing Team is a group of avid cyclists that ride from the D'Ornella's Bike Shop. Eon D'Ornellas, four time Olympian, started the shop some 20 years ago to bring his wealth of knownledge of cycling&nbsp; to the Toronto area (ie. Crappy Tire is not a good place to buy a bike). While the club does have many members that race their bikes in local events, many just ride with the club to keep fit (and to stay fast).

  I joined the club in January 2009 starting indoors at the D'Ornella's Fitness Factory riding a trainer indoors to get myself in shape to the outdoor season. Eon's first reaction to me was that I needed to learn how to ride a bike and recommended the club coach, Audbrey Bryce. With Audbrey, I did a fitness test and purchased his training plans. It worked. When I started indoors I was dying a slow death each session, but it paid off - on the first official club ride outside I managed to keep up with the group (although I am still learning how to ride a bike).

  Group rides happen almost every Saturday and Sunday in the morning. Some rides also happen during the week in the mornings, but these rides then to be more spur of the moment affairs. The club also runs time trials every Wednesday.
