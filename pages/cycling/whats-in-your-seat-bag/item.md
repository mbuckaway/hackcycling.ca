---title: What's in your seat bag?visible: true---I had a new experience yesterday I would not like to repeat. On a long ride out in the middle of no where, I was pedaling with a group on a group ride and all of a sudden my chain appeared to slip off the big ring and drop. I thought it might have been a Schleck moment, so I tried to keep pedalling to re-engage the chain. Someone behind me screamed "BROKEN CHAIN". Broken chain? I stopped and got off the bike. Sure enough, one of the link pins came lose, jammed up against the front derailer, and bent the chain link. So, here I was with the group in the middle of no where, some 40km from my car, and I had a broken chain. Funny, a week prior to this event, I took the big heavy tool from my seatbag (you know, the one with the chain breaker on it), and replaced it with a lighter tool. Unfortunately, no one else on the ride had a chain breaker tool - all for the same reason: lighten up the seat bag. I managed to hitch a ride from a guy "Dave" in a pickup truck to the closest town, and called a cab. $35 later ($20 of some elses money), I was back at the car. I am very grateful for Dave to picking me up; however,&nbsp; I missed the ride, had a broken bike, and missed a workout.

So the question arises: what does one carry in the seat bag and/or on the bike? It is one of those things you never really think about until it is too late. From this experience, I learned that the 100g saved in weight by not carrying a good multitool is not worth it.

Thus, here is a list of what MUST appear on your bike for long rides:

Seatbag:

  * Spare Tube (two if you have space)
  * Tire levels (even if you can change a tube by hand, after 159km, you may be too tired to do so)
  * Two CO2 cartridges and a CO2 inflator. You need two CO2 cartridges in case you screw one of them up.
  * Multitool with chain breaker. Don't skim here.

Bike:

  * Mini-pump. Used to particularly inflate the tire when chaining it or if you completely mess up the CO2 cartridges. You don't really want to spend 15 mins pumping up a tire, so CO2 is a must.
  * Spare pre-glued tire (if you are using tubulars).

Jersey pocket:

  * Some form of ID. I use my racing license and wear a <a title="Road ID" href="http://www.roadid.com" target="_blank">Road ID</a> around my neck. This is about what happens if you go down, and can't speak for yourself.
  * Tim Hortons' Card and/or Starbucks card (or whatever your local coffee shop is). When you are stuck and out of money, these things made a good backup. Nevermind, says the bother of fumbling around with lose change in the jersey pocket after you've bought the despartly needed cup'o'joe.
  * Credit card. Backup for a cab ride. Some cabbies do not do credit cards, though.
  * $40 cash. I used to carry $20, but will now carry $40 due to the expense of the cab fair.
  * Cell phone. This will be your only link to civilzation if you are stuck and there is no one around to hitch a ride.
  * CAA membership. If you are a CAA member, you can make a call to CAA for a bike assist.

There are other obvious things to carry like food,&nbsp; gels, etc.; but you should already be doing that. I see the above as the minimum to carry to make sure your managed to make it back from a ride. The idea is to not let a flat or a broken chain stop the ride from continuing. And, if it can't continue, you have a method getting help and getting back home.
