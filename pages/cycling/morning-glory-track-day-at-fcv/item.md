---title: Morning Glory Track Day at FCVvisible: true---<div>
  The Morning Glory Cycling Club in conjuction with Hackcycling has arranged for a Track Day at the Forest City Velodrome in London, ON on Saturday, November 19. The team will take to the track at noon for a two hour session on "Learn to Ride the Track" and will follow it by a one hour skills session. The group will then change and go find pub/restaurant to get dinner. The team will return to the track around 6:30pm to watch the racing action as the racers, including the master Hack himself, Mark Buckaway, take to the track to race.<br /><br />The track has been reserved for 14 Morning Glory CC members. The cost is $30 and includes the track time and bike rental. Riders are to dress for the weather outside and bring their pedals, cycling shows, water bottled, and pump. The temp is usually around 10-13C inside the Velodrome so riders are warned to bring arm warmers, knee warmers, vest, long finger gloves, and anything else you would normally ware outside on a overcast dry day outside at that temperature.<br /><br />The FCV website is <a target="_blank" title="FCV Website" href="http://www.ForestCityVelodrome.ca">http://ForestCityVelodrome.ca</a><br />
