---title: Road Trip: Track weekendvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  I can still recall seeing a old photo of a old Forest City Velodrome member riding at the Masters Track World Championships. Since I started at the Forest City Velodrome, I've taking to liking track racing more than the road. I have a goal to compete and win in the Provincial Track Championships this year, race competitively at the Track Nationals next year, and place at Nationals the year following. I figure when I can compete at Nationals and place or do well, I can seriously consider booking the trip to Masters Track Worlds and representing Canada. In the meantime, I have a lot of work to do.

  This year I decided to keep up with Wednesday training at the Forest City Velodrome and that has helped. I kind of fell into going to the International Velodrome at Bloomer Park. One of the FCV regulars, I know, makes trips out there, and urged me to go with him. When it couldn't make it, I decided to go on my own and I've been there some five times this summer. I have also been to the track in Cleveland on my own. So, magically, this summer I have had a fair amount of track racing and riding time. This weekend two major events at these two tracks happened to line up perfectly.

  Racing at the Cleveland Velodrome is Friday and Saturday. I won't be at the Friday night event, because I can't justify taking another Friday off work. I've been at the Friday race nights at Bloomer Park three Fridays in August. So, I plan to leave late afternoon Friday and stay overnight in Cleveland. It's about 5-6hr drive from Toronto. Time Trial events start in Cleveland at 9AM and the mass start events start at 4PM. It will be a long day. I booked a fleebag hotel close to the track and will stay there Friday and Saturday nights. If there is some kind of party after on Saturday, I will be able to stick around for it. Saturday morning I will trek off to Rochester Hills, MI. This is a 4-5 hr drive from Cleveland. Racing at Bloomer Park starts at 2PM, but I want to be there before noon to get some time on the track, so it will be an early start Sunday morning. I'm hoping to meet fellow a FCV'er at Bloomer Park. I would like to an individual pursuit against him and race the Madison with him as my partner.

  This weekend will cost a few bucks, but its all for training on the track doing events that will be done at the track provincials in two weeks. I'm hoping the experience of lots of track racing will help put me on the podium over the others that plan to show up (some with little or no track time). I know, last year, I spend a whole four sessions at the FCV prior to provincials and came in last place in ALL events. I swore this kind of result would never happen again.

  Wish me luck. I hope to see some podium placing this weekend considering I was almost on the poduim last Friday at Bloomer Park for the Miss and Out championship. It will be a lot of driving, but it will be fun.
