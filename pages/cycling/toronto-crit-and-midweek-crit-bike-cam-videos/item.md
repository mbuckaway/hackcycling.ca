---title: Toronto Crit and Midweek Crit bike cam videosvisible: true---About two weeks ago, I purchased a Oregon Scientific ATC9K sports camera. I had been using Contour HD cams, but found they are unreliable, tend to break and stop working randomly.&nbsp; I don't know how many rides I missed filming because one of the Contours shutoff for no reason during a ride. Further, the ATC9K also comes build into a waterproof case (good to 20m) which is completely unlike the GOPro and Contour cams that require a special case. It also has a LCD screen to allow review of the action in the field and make setup easier.

Anyways, I mounted it on my bike below the stem and rode with it in the Toronto Crit and Midweek Crit last week. I spent a bit more time on the Midweek Crit video because I rode with my powertap wheel, and therefore, I have the telemetry on the video. It is interested to see 900W+ off the line when I jumped off the front of the pack on the start and how many times I was pushing between 400-500W during the race. I would have liked to do that for the Toronto Crit video, but I was too worried about just managing to finish the race.
