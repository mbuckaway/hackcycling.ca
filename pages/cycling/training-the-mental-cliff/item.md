---title: Training the Mental Cliffvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  Rather than spend time typing a blog, I decided to vlog. While this is somewhat of an experiment, the one take grabbed most of what I wanted to say.

  The one thing I learned on Monday was one needs to train using efforts of unknown durations in order to test the "mental cliff" - that point in an all out effort where you just want to quit, but have to keep going. I think we spend too much time working out to a clock or racing to the lap counter and need to train more with all out efforts with unknown distance.
