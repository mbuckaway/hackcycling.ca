---title: Dressing for the weathervisible: true---After riding in the "cold", the last few weeks, I found that Veloist Jim rides year around. Apparently, he has been on the Donut Ride when it's -12C out. At first, this seemed someone insane, until you consider many people look forward to skiing when the weather gets cold and dress a lot like a cyclist, but instead strap on skiis. If anyone does cross country skiing, the clothing is largely the same. My other cycling buddy Ron, also skiis and on most rides is wearing some ski clothing.

Given, until year or so ago, I never ventured outside for anything other than shovelling the driveway on a cold day, the topic of what to wear on a ride came up. Below is what Jim suggested. He has been riding year around for many years.

  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Dressing in -10. If done properly you are good for 2.5 - 3 hours max, -15C - 2 - 2.5 hours Max, -20C - 1 - 1.5 hours Max</span>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Winter cycling shoes. The booty type, with a heat pack over the toes and outer liners. I use North Wave <a href="http://www.northwave.com/usa/shoes_det.php?itemid=30&catid=4&area=4 " target="_blank" title="Winter Cycling Boots"><span id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT305" class="Object">http://www.northwave.com/usa/shoes_det.php?itemid=30&catid=4&area=4</span> </a>and are very happy with them. Buy them 1 Euro size too big as your will be wearing thick wool socks. I like Defeet winter cycling socks. </span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">I have experimented with a very thin liner sock instead of the heat pack and it is a trade off. For example, I use a liner cross country skiing but do not use a heat pack as I do not get the wind factor and my toes move allot.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Lobster claw gloves with a base liner or a thin pair of inner gloves and mitts.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Always keep an extra heat pack to put inside the gloves if necessary. Heat packs can be bought at Costco for about 50cents a pair.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Mid weight Base layer , Micro fleece mid layer with a Mid weight soft shell Jacket or a Nylon cycle jacket with aÂ  breathable back and opportunity for venting. i.e.; zippers to allow air flow.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Extra Base Layer for half way point to change. It is dry and you will feel warm and dry again when you get back outside.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">I wear regular cycling shorts under my long pants that have a Nylon front to Block the wind and I am good.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">I wear my regular helmet with a Micro Fleece lined cap and have a pair of collapsible ear muffs that work really well.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">I find the helmet covers do not allow for the breathability required as it keeps the air locked in creating head sweat.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">When it is really cold I wear one of those micro ski masks to save my face.</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">My experience is:</span>
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="checklist">
    Keep the hands warm, not hot
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="checklist">
    Keep the toes warm, not hot
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="checklist">
    Block the front of your body from the wind
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="checklist">
    Keep your ears warm, not hot
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="checklist">
    Block the wind from your head, do not let your head get too warm as your head regulates your body temperature.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="checklist">
    Keep the back of your neck covered, but do not wear a turtle neck.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
    <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Your body is regulated by the back of your neck first, than your head, than the rest of your body goes.</span>
