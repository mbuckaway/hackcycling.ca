---title: VLOG: Migrating from Trainer to Roadvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  This spring in Toronto has been, well, a lot like winter. It's April, and it's still in the single digits in the morning. And, as Sat happened to show, it sometimes doesn't get warm in the afternoon. I had planned to do the Donut Ride on Sat. April, 5 as training for the Calibogie race the following weekend, but I awoke to see snow on the ground. Not something I expected. This VLOG post goes through some of the thought processes I experienced that morning.
