---title: Stupid Drivers/Cyclists: Share the Roadvisible: true---Since starting a new job in Downtown Toronto last month, I have been looking forward to getting out of my car and of the GO Train and onto my bike for my daily commute. While I used to drive to Oakville from the east end of Toronto, I now cycle into the office. The driver used to take 40-60mins or longer and my cycle commute now takes about 50-55mins depending on traffic.

With the increase in my road use, I find that I am almost killed more frequently on the roads. There are sections of lower Bayview Avenue here in Toronto where cars believe overtaking me at 80km/h to get to an onramp and cutting in front of me is a good thing to do. I have been narrowly missed numerous times. I have learned to take my lane when the situation warrents it. I thank drivers that give way even when then do not have to.

This leads me to a recent article on BikeRadar that discusses sharing the road in Bristol, UK. This is well balanced article that discusses stupid drivers and stupid cyclists equally. It actually mentions that the cyclist with the cheap department store bike with no skill whatsoever is more dangerous than your average roady. I happen to agree.

You can read the article at <a target="_blank" title="How to Share the Road" href="http://www.bikeradar.com/news/article/do-dangerous-cyclists-put-us-all-at-risk-29610?CPN=RSS&SOURCE=BRGENHOME">Bike Radar</a>.

I have a few personal rules I tend to follow:

- the sidewalk is for pedritians (tell that so some idiot drivers!) Bikes belong on the road.

- lights are required 30mins before dark and 30 mins before sunrise (30 mins minumum). I've been in situations as a driver which I saw a cyclist because he had a light on his bike well before sunset.

- bells on bikes are useful if your commute uses any sort of trail that might be used by runners, skateboarders, etc.. You will get a thank you from some people as you ride by.

- be mindful that in a fight with a car, the cyclist will end up in the hospital regardless who is at fault. I wish some drivers realized that fact when they buzz by ever so close.

So, when riding, be careful out there. Ride defensively and trust no road user. One need to look out for oneself. As a driver, be mindful that there is little between the road and the cyclist. We need to learn to share the road...and I mean both the cyclist and the driver.
