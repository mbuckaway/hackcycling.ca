---title: Paris Ancaster Race Donevisible: true---I did complete without incident the race from Paris to Ancaster. Even though I really didn't do much better than last year, I had fun doing the race. My time on the course was 2:38 and last year I was out there for 2:43. Methinks the best thing I did differently from last year was going out on Saturday and riding the start and finishing ends of the course - as much as one can do without invading private property. Thus, I know the course at both ends which made the actually riding more enjoyable because I knew where I was and what to expect. I rode that hill at the end, so I knew where the hard spot was and that once over that bit, it's fairly "easy" to continue up the hill.

I rode in Wave 1. I managed to get near the front of the group, but probably should have been near the back. The pack took off like it did last year and hammered it full out for the first 10km of the ride. I couldn't hang on. I just didn't have the legs. I seem to recall the pace was up to 40km/h at one point. I spent too much time sitting around over the last month and not working out. However, I managed to stick with a group that was going the same pace as me, and it worked out. I had set my Garmin 705 to keep track of the distance travelled, and this setting was a godsent because I knew where I was and how far I had to go.

At the 10km point, there was the stone road up to the first farmers field. Too many people decided NOT to ride it which caused a bottleneck. I rode up it the day before and it wasn't hard. But, with everyone walking, I had no choice. From there, it was from field to gravel road to road to field to single track, etc.. Unlike last year, because I spent the fall learning how to ride a cross bike, I actually preferred the offroad sections. I could usually pass others on the hills. The road sections were another matter entirely. There were winds upwards of 50km/h either from the side (crosswinds) or head on. On the occasion there were from behind, but it was more the exception than the rule. The winds hurt. I think there is where I lost more of my time. I should have been able to do some 30km/h, but at times was fighting to maintain 10km/h. At one point, the cross winds almost blew me off my bike. I am sure it didn't affect the leader much who no doubt stuck together and worked together.

Then there was a the mud. I poured rain the day before so everything offroad was a mudbath. Some of the single track was soaked bad enough to puddle. There was one section where it was puddle after puddle. I fell off my bike in one of them as I got stuck and didn't unclip in time. I was drenched on one side - luckily, I was wearing a rain jacket, so my core stayed dry. The end of the race sees the rider go through several "mudslides". The Powerline Mudslide was the longest one...although, it signals the end of the race is near. That mudslide took too long to get through. Some mountain bikers managed to ride it. I wasn't as daring.

The end of the race is finished when you climb up a 11% grade. After 60km of riding, it's hell. It was much easier the previous day. However, I was determined NOT to walk up the hill. I geared down and pushed as hard as I could on the pedals shifting the bike forward by the handlebars with each pedal stroke. &nbsp;I just didn't have the energy to stand on the pedals and I was determined to ride to the finish. I rode sections of the course I walked the year prior, and damn if I was going to walk the last 500m of the course. However, I made it to the top and noted my top of 2:38 and happy to have completed the race.

I fun doing the race. I don't really care that my time wasn't less the the 2:24 I wanted. However, I could have improved somewhat by:

- doing more zone 4 intervals a month prior to the race. I wasn't ready for the long hard effort.

- strapping gels to the bike frame. I ran out of gas about 2/3's of the way into the race and had to stop to gel up because the gels were stuck in my jersey pocket, barried until my jacket. Once I gelled up, I was about to keep the pace of the faster riders.

- I need a lighter bike. My cross bike rides like a brick.

So, next year, perhaps I do better on the timing, but regardless of the snow, hail, cold weather, mud, etc. It was a fun ride.
