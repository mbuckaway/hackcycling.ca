---title: D'Ornellas Club Championship experiencevisible: true---<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Over the last week, our Club, the <a title="D'Ornellas Racing Team" href="http://www.dornellas.com/theclub" target="_blank">D'Ornellas Racing Team and Cycling Club </a>held there club championships. It is a stage race considering of a time trail, a road race, and a criterium. The Time Trail was held on the Wednesday prior to the weekend at the club's regular TT event. The Road Race was held in Ashburn (north Whitby) on Saturday. The criterium was held as part of the Markham Giro today, Sunday.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">For the criterium, we road in the rain. It started to pour about the time the race started. First two laps were neutralized and I spent those laps trying to see where I was going&nbsp;because of the salt in my eyes. I really have to remember to wash out my helmet weekly or before any ride with the hint of rain. We hit the first corner on the third lap, some people got scared, slowed up, and by the time the pack took off, I was too far behind to catch up. I road the course sharing the workload with club member Mike so we would finish&nbsp;and not get lapped. We did try to catch them and came without 10 seconds of catching them, but we just could not get fast enough to latch on. There was a nasty northerly wind on the back section of the course which did help us. We probably finished about 1-2 mins behind the pack. We didn't see them for most of the race. If it were not for my inability to see, I would have pushed my way up to the front and rode beside Ken for the neutralized laps. In that way, I would have been able to stay with the pack and it would have been an easy ride. Mike and I worked out asses off to keep the pace high and not get lapped.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">The road race was much better...albeit 12C at the start. 38km/h average for the A group, the group I was in, for 65km. The race was split into four groups depending on speed and ran on a 10.2km course doing six laps up in and around Ashburn north of Whitby. Groups started out about five minutes apart with the D group going first. The A group went last. We managed to lap the B group with five or six laps to go. There was a hill challenge on the course. It was a short burst (about 100-150m) of a hill that topped out about 9%. I could feel the legs turning to rubber on this hill on the second last and I knew I was in for trouble on the last lap. That hill killed me on the last lap, I fell off the pack on the hill,&nbsp;almost managed to catch them by the finish,&nbsp;and I finished just behind the pack by about 3 secs. That was a deadly ride. It took 18 hours to recover from it.</span>

  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">I came in 7th on the TT on Wednesday. 38.3 average on my road bike for a time of 23:29. Best time was 19:49 or something for a speed of just over 41km/h. I am in the market for a TT bike now so I can do better. Apparently, if I had a TT bike I should be able to do the course in about 20 mins or 40km/h.</span>

  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">So, next year I should do better. It's a matter of experience, knowing how hard to go, where to be in the pack, when to be there, and what do to.</span>
