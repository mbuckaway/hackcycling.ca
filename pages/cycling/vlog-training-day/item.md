---title: VLOG: Training Dayvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  Last year, I had a rough start to the season because while I had a lot of intensity, I didn't get my endurance work. Track races are extremely hard, but also very short. Typically, 12 mins or less. So, this year I look hard at my schedule. I was not willing to give up strength training, because that has effects well beyond that of the bike. So, I just added cycling training to the same days I do strength training. I had to say, I am much better for it. Last year, I would be dragging myself from FITS...and this year, so far, I'm full of energy.

  Two weeks ago, I took the bike cam and brought it around with me on my day. I took some video of the ride outside in the cold (-10C), at the <a href="http://www.realdealracing.ca" title="Real Deal Performance" target="_blank">Real Deal Performance</a> studio, and at the <a href="http://www.fitstoronto.com" title="FITS Toronto" target="_blank">FITS Toronto</a> center. Check out the video below.
