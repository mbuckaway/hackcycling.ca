---title: Blue Mountain Gran Fondo Recon Sunday August 1 8AMvisible: true---WHEN: Sunday, August 1 at 8AM  
WHERE: Meet at the Starbucks in the Blue Mountain village (see below)  
WHAT: Ride the Gran Fondo route. 170km with 2000m of climbing.  
  
The better we know the route of the Blue Mountain Gran Fondo by the time Sept. 19 rolls around, the better. If you are registered for doing the Gran Fondo, I urge to come to this ride and do the full route. If you are not registered, fell free to join us. There are options to go shorter than 170KM. It's a good ride with some good climbs and some long descents. I hit 80km/h last time. Strongly advice riders have a compact chainring or something like a 12-27/11-28 on the back unless you are really strong.&nbsp;

Last ride a month ago, we waited for the slower riders when appropriate. We will stop in Creemore again (70km) for water/snacks and the stop midway to the end point or as the group requires.
  
  
The route map we rode is&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://tpks.ws/WxXA" target="_blank">http://tpks.ws/WxXA</a>. This route was recorded off my Garmin.  
  
The meeting point is a bit of fun to find if you've never skied Blue Mountain. Drive into the village and park in lot #2. This will be designated from the road. Walk/ride towards the village/ski lifts and you will pass Starbucks. There is no mention of Starbucks from the road. Plan to take 2 hours to drive there.
