  Tuesday, June 17 is the day I raced a bike.

  First, I have been doing the Learn to Race course through the Midweek bike club on Monday nights in the depths of Mississauga near Centenial Park. I have found the races with this group fairly easy. For the most part, I've managed to stay in the top three finishers of the races held at the end of each night. This last Monday, I finished either second or third of a 14 lap race (14km). The pace was manageable. Most of the people in this group are still afraid to attack or give up if they are passed. Of course, racing with a group of newbies (of which, I make no mistake, I am one of them) gives a person a false sense of accomplishment.

  Midweek Bike Club also runs Tuesday night races on the same Crit course. I did that on Tuesday. While there were some Learn to Race people there, most are avid racers using the race as a&nbsp;training exercise. There are two races the B race at 6:45pm and the A race at 7:20pm. I did the B race. 24 laps around a 1KM and a bit course. The pace was faster....MUCH FASTER. I started at the front and for some reason never bothered to jump when after the first corner a few racers attacked. I don't know where my legs were....they just didn't seem to want to go. As soon as others attacked, I had to jump. The pace pushed up for the first 8 laps or so. Harder, harder, harder. Non-stop go. I recall looking at my heart rate and I do not think it dropped below 160BPM for the entire race. I normally never ride that hard (which I think was one of the problems). Being new, I never seemed to know where to be on the pack. For whatever reason, I always seemed to be off the side, nose into the wind - a bad place to be. I also found myself falling back numerous times and sprinted to catch the back of the pack - each sprint burned another match. I can see why it is important to stay near the front of the pack. When the pack slows on a corner, you kill yourself picking up the pace again. I can recall the 14th lap asking myself why I was doing this - it hurt. I never worked so hard. I was asked by one of the Midweek crew to join in a break at the 5th last lap. However, they were no where to be found, and it was all I could do to hang on. I managed to finish the race midpack. I am happy with my performance considering it was my first "real" race and my intent was to finish mid pack. As with the Learn to Race course, its learn as you go.

  Next week I will do it again, and try hard to get to the front and stay there. I will also work harder during the warm up. When the heart rate stays high for 30 mins, it is important to warm the legs and lungs up before the race. I found my legs and lungs where not ready. A warm up must hit race pace. I also must come well hydrated. There is little opportunity to drink in that small Crit course. I can do better and will do better.
