---title: Chinese Carbon: The Black Knight buildvisible: true---<div>
  The first Chinese bike I built was based on a FM015 from <a title="Hong Fu Bikes" href="http://www.hongfu-bikes.com" target="_blank">HongFu Bikes</a>. My Vitess Red had it's top tube smashed and seat stay damaged in the Calabogie race in April. I used the parts from my Vitess to build out the FM015. I may still get my Vitess replaced/repaired - nothing I have rides like it.<br /><br />The bike therefore has the following build list:<br />- FM015 Frame and matching fork<br />- DuraAce 7900 group with 53/39 175mm crankset, 11-25 casette, white cable housings<br />- C50 50mm Vitess branded carbon clinchers with a PowerTap SL+<br />- Swisstop Yellow brake pads<br />- 3T carbon stem and seat post<br />- standard English BB<br />- Fizik seat<br />- Speedplay Zero steel shaft pedals<br />- Hong Fu carbon bottle cages<br />- Garmin cadence/speed sensor and garmin 705 mount<br />- Name stickers obtains from the Morning Glory Cycling Club<br />

Both items has since been corrected. It's been a good bike which I had raced since and taken to France to ride over there. With my Mavic alloy wheels, this machine was a dream to ride up and down mountains. With the carbon wheels, I found it a bit twitchy....which I have since discovered is the characteristics of a sprint bike (in track terminology). So, it's the perfect bike to be racing crits.<br /><br />I call this bike crash proof - why? I crashed out of the Tour of Terra Cotta and it never received a scratch. Chinese carbon rocks!<br />&nbsp;
