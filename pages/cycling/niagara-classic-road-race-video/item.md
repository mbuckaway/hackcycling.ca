---title: Niagara Classic Road Race Videovisible: true---<div>
  I rode with my bike cam at the Niagara Classic RR this past weekend. While I am stilling in the process of editing the video down to under 10 mins, I created a full length version I cut to DVD for winter training. I uploaded to Vimeo in case others want to view it. The best part of the last 20 mins of the flick because that is the final lap.<br /><br />[vimeo]27913020[/vimeo]
