---title: Cycling and Marriagevisible: true---<div>
  Married guys know that a love of cycling sometimes (read: almost always) doesn't mix with marriage unless the wife has a similar passion for cycling, running, or the like or is willing to support the addiction. In my case, being not-married worked out because I no longer have to concern myself with the concerns of the other half. But, I've been there, thus, this image rings bells with me:<br />

  I can recommend, if single or divorced, to find a friend that is into a similar sport and has a similar addiction. I know from experience how it feels to have one's idea for a evening our on a rest day undone by the words, "Sorry, I have a ride/workout planned". It actually feels good because there are times when those words come from my mouth and guilty I feel not.
