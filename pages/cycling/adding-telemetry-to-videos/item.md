---title: Adding Telemetry to Videosvisible: true---<div>
  As I at the Forest City Velodrome this week for the Xmas Training Camp, one of the questions that usually comes up when I pull out my bike cam is how do I get the dials or telemetry on my videos. It was pointed out to me some time ago that a guy in the UK under the alias of VeryMadMart wrote his own utility in Java to generate quicktime videos from the data off his Garmin device. In my case, &nbsp;I use a Garmin 705 with cadence and heart rate, and when on my road bike, I also have power available to me if I am riding with my powertap wheel. At the track, I have cadence and heart rate - I out a sensor on the track bike.<br /><br />Anyone interested in using this tool for their own videos can find it at:<br /><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/verymadmart/cyclecam">http://sites.google.com/site/verymadmart/cyclecam</a>&nbsp;<br /><br />It is easy to use. Just export your TCX file from your garmin, and run the software over it. While it does allow you to also load in our video and merge the telemetry and video together, I prefer to do this part in Final Cut Pro X on my Mac Pro. That allows me to combine the pieces of the video together that I want because I do not always start the garmin at the same time as a the video (especially at the track).<br /><br />Stay tunes for the latest video. I raced the track last night and had the bike cam running on a very hard race.<br />&nbsp;
