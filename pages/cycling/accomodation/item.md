  We will stay in rented houses in Limoux and Bouriege. The house in Limoux can sleep seven in individual rooms and the house in Bouriege can sleep five individuals (or three couples). The accomodations have private rooms, but you will share the common areas such as the livingroom, kitchen, and bathrooms.

  The first house is 21 rue des Oules, Limoux and is designed with cyclists in mind. It has 7 rooms each with a Ikea style single bed, desk, lamp. One room has an Ikea style double bed which will go to the first person booking into this house. There are two bathooms which we share. It has a full kitchen with two fridges. &nbsp;Bikes hang in the kitchen on the wall. If you like the idea is being at the town square in the afternoons, you will want to stay here. The town square is just outside its door. This house is best suited for those that like to be out in the town square soaking up the atmosphere.

  The house in Bouriege isn't specifically for cyclists, but it has lots of common space, a heated pool, a huge commercial style kitchen, a BBQ's, patio above the pool, and patio across the street. So, there is space to work on your tan after a ride or just spend some alone time. Each of the rooms has a large double bed. There are two large bathrooms. If you have been to Limoux before, I suggest staying here. The beds are bigger and there is more space. However, while there is a cafe in town, (literally beside the house), it's 12km outside of Limoux. So, you will a ride to/from town in the tour's van or you can hop on your bike into town. This house is best suited to those who need a little down time after a ride or prefer better accomodation.

  All houses have a large livingrooms with TV and free WIFI. The house in Bouriege has several common areas. The tour is always available to watch in the afternoon on TV or a local cafe/pub in Limoux. Everything in Limoux is in walking distance. There is a Walmart style store a 30min walk/10min ride/short drive on the edge of Limoux. Food is either bought locally and made in the kitchen, or a short walk to places in the town square for things like fine french food to American style fries. If you want to hang out in a place where no one speaks French, the local Irish Pub has Guinness on tap.

  Can I bring my spouse/significant other? If you would bring them on your usual club ride, and they keep up with you, then please do bring them. You must stay in the Bouriege house because this house can accomodate couples and the house in Limoux only has single beds.&nbsp;
