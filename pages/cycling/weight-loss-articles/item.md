---title: Weight Loss Articlesvisible: true---There is a lot of useless information on weight loss available. Book shelves are filled with "Lose 50lbs in 10 days" kind of nosense. From my own personal experience, losing weight is possible. I lost 70lbs and dropped from from a 42" waist to 34" waist by doing nothing else than eating right and exercising. &nbsp;It's a magically weight lose program. It also takes time. For me, 70lbs came off in about 1-1.5 years. It won't happen overnight. Weight loss requires a lifestyle change.

Part of the issue with weight loss is understanding that the average person requires only 2000 calories per day to maintain their weight. What most people fail to understand is how little food this actually is. A stay in the hospital will demonstrate to anyone what a 2000 calorie diet real is. Three meals per day with small portions.

It is easy to blow over the 2000 calorie limit in one sitting. A typical large bag of potato chips contains upwards of 800 calories. A 500ml bottle of pop (soda) contains 400 calories. A 500ml carton of chocolate milk is 300 calories. Get the picture?

Of course, one need only including workouts in one's day to increase the amount of calories one requires. But more people have this notion that walking up the stairs instead of taking the elevator at the office will make a difference. Exercise requires that the heart rate become elevated for an extended period of time. One need work at it. A cyclist out on a hard ride can burn up to 1000 cals/hour. Someone taking the stairs may burn an extra 20 calories. 

 

The point I am really trying to make is some knowledge and understanding is required to lose weight and get fit. Knowledge is also gained through good sources. One of the sources I find useful is the Science of Sport website and blog. The blog currently has a series on weight loss that is worth the read. Check it out. Understand some of the issues concerning weight loss. The link is below.
