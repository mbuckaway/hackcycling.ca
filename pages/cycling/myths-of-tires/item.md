---title: Myths of Tiresvisible: true---There are quite of a few things about bike tires that seem to be well accepted in the community. BikeRadar has done a piece with some data collected from a company called Wheel Energy.

Some of the common things they discovered:

  1. Puncture belts work by are not all created equal
  2. Wider tires roll faster than narrow tires (yes, you read that correctly)
  3. Inner tubes matter
  4. Larger diameter wheels roll faster than smaller ones (29er's are a good idea)
  5. Thread pattern matters
  6. Higher thread counts aren't always better
