---title: Club Ride on Saturdayvisible: true---<div style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: hidden;" id="_mcePaste">
  After a three month "break" from cycling due to my broken leg, I managed to get out for a club ride with the D'Ornella's Bike Club today (Ride data: http://tpks.ws/dvz4). My original intend was to ride with my biking partner for 75km, but he bailed midweek. I decided to ride with the club instead and risk getting dropped from the group. My original plan was to ride with the club next week after I managed to get my legs back for the longer ride. Todays ride was planned to be 90km; however, the threat of rain scared the ride leader into cutting the ride short. It ended up being only about 80km from the bike ship for a three hour tour. I am back from the ride as I type this entry and a  hour has passed since end of the ride, yet it still is not raining. However, I am happy the ride was cut short because we end of missing some large hills which I may had had issues getting over.

  On a solo ride last weekend in Peterborough, I managed to get out and club some hills. So far, I can climb short hills of up to 9%, but it is a real effort with only one good working leg. The planned ride for today would have taken us up Consession 2 which has three 12% grade hills in a row - something I had issues with in the past when both legs worked; therefore, as a first ride back with the club, I am happy to have missed them (this time).

  Thus, because I have proven I can ride at least 80km (three hours) without dying, I can keep riding weekends with the club and build back my strength. Now I will work on going longer and harder as I build back my legs to be able to stand on the hills and sprint with the rest of the group.
