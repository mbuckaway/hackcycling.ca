---title: Mayor Ford Responds: Stats support Jarvis removalvisible: true---Well, I just recieved a response to my email to Major Ford's office. I say office, because I am sure it was not the mayor himselt that responded. Also, the email did not address my concerns exactly, so I expect one of the staff crafted the canned respond to anything about the Jarvis St. bike lane removal. However, assuming the stats are correct, the bike lane removal makes sense if only 600 cyclists/day use them and 15,000 cars use the same road each day. I still think it's a waste of the taxpayers money to remove the lanes when Jarvis St. needs road repairs first. Nevermind, the money being wasted on new bike lanes when roads like Richmond St need to be fixed.

I will still ride up and down Jarvis St....but I will do it by taking a lane when I need to like any other street I ride on.

However, here is the Mayor's response:

Thank you for your email regarding the bike lanes on Jarvis Street. &nbsp;I appreciate hearing from you.   
  
Toronto's economy loses billions of dollars every year from gridlock and traffic congestion. &nbsp;We need to make the situation better - not worse. &nbsp; The Jarvis Street bike lanes experiment has been a failure. &nbsp;Ninety-four percent of commuters now face longer commutes on Jarvis Street. &nbsp; Over 15,000 commuters each day are suffering from longer travel times, for the sake of 600 additional cyclists.  
  
The City should remove the bike lanes as soon as possible and improve travel times for thousands of daily commuters. &nbsp;City staff have been directed to develop a low-cost plan to do so. &nbsp; Bike lanes were never intended to be installed on Jarvis Street. &nbsp;The original Environmental Assessment recommended against installing bike lanes - but City Council amended the report to approve bike lanes anyway.  
  
As promised during the mayoral election, I am dedicated to delivering customer service excellence, creating a transparent and accountable government, reducing the size and cost of government and building a transportation city.  
  
Thank you again for taking the time to share your thoughts. Please feel free to contact my office again at any time.  
  
Yours truly,  
  
Mayor Rob Ford   
City of Toronto
