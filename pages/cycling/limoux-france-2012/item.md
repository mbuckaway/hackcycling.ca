  <br />The Tour de France starts again in Limoux. Stage 14 is on Sunday, July 15: <a href="http://www.cyclismactu.net/news-tour-de-france-2012-le-parcours-devoile-par-erreur-19884.html" title="Le Tour de France" target="_blank">DETAILS</a><br />We could be in Paris for the final stage as well. See below.<br /><br /><a target="_blank" title="France July 2011" href="http://photos.hackcycling.ca/dornellasfrance2011/">LINK: PHOTOS FROM JULY 2011</a><br /><br /><a target="_blank" title="Kiwi House France" href="images/kiwihouse_france.pdf">LINK: PDF FILE OF THE HOUSE</a><br /><br /><a target="_blank" title="LINK: WEBSITE FOR HOUSE OWNER" href="http://www.lemonastere.com">LINK: WEBSITE FOR HOUSE OWNER</a><br /><br />Overview:<br /><br />This is a trip for anyone on a budget that doesn't have $2000-4000CND to drop on a fully supported two week trip in France.<br /><br />The plan for the trip to Limoux, France for Saturday, July 7, 2012 to Saturday, July 21, 2012. These dates do no conflict with Canadian Nationals which are at the end of June. The tour starts in Limoux on Sunday, July 15. We will stay in a rented house in Limoux, France that has: six separate bedrooms with single bed in each, two washrooms with showers, and a large eat in kitchen. Click on the link about to see photos of the house. The house is in the center of town and everything we need is in walking distance or a short bike ride. The town is well suited to tourists and if your french is bad, you need only point and they understand. Clara Hughes and some other notable athletes have stayed in these houses and trained there. I stayed there in July 2011.<br /><br />The first house address is 21 rue des Oules, 11300 Limoux, France<span id="_plain_text_marker">. The tour starts about 300m down the street from the house. The town square is some 300m the other way. The second house is across the river and it's address is&nbsp;46 rue Blanquérie, 11300 Limoux, France. This house is on Google Steetview.</span><br /><br />The plan is to make food ourselves in the house and we will share the costs. However, there are lots of restaurants in the area. Pastries and bread are ALWAY fresh from the many bakeries. Burgers and fries are available in the town square if just can't do French food. We can get milk/cereal/eggs/etc. for our breakfasts and share making lunches/dinners or eat out.<br /><br />Flights are best taken via Air France. The flights are from Toronto to Paris, and then Paris to Toulouse. From Toulose we will arrange transport for us and our bikes. There are services that specialize in such things. They will pick us up from the airport and bring us and our bikes to the house. The same will happen for the return. <br /><br />Limoux is about 45km from the mountains. Limoux itself is on a river in a valley. This means everything out of the town is a climb. There are hills varying from 1% to 18%. There are many good cycling routes, and almost all including some kind of hill; although, the route to Quenlan is flat because it runs through the river valley.<br /><br />The trip is suitable for those that have raced in the past, have current racing licenses, or those who typically lead sprints in group rides and can average 28-30km/h avg on the flats.&nbsp; You should be capable of riding a 100mile century ride without a support vehicle (we stop at cafes for water/coffee). The first week we will ride the area, and the second week will race for those that are interested. The owner of the house is the local bike club president and has offered to assist us with licensing issues and signing up for races.<br /><br />The plan is to ride in the morning, and watch the Tour de France in the afternoon. There is no need to trek out to the start of a stage - Limoux is hosting the start of Stage 14. You can walk to the start location. It's down the street from the house. Plan to stay in town that day because it is shutdown for the tour. Last year, the Garmin team was more than accomodating allow our group to get photos and autographs. If you are adventurous, we can ride out to the tour route after the stage start through some of the back roads (the tour route is police patrolled and you can't drive or ride your bike on it - I tried).<br /><br />What we do while there will be up to the group. If you want to sit around the pubs and drink rather that ride, all the power to you. If you want to ride 200km/day, sure...we can do that to (or you can). If you want to do a tour of the 30 wineries in the area, great. I am sure someone will join you.<br /><br />

  <br />RIDING DETAILS:<br /><br />My recommendation is for everyone to dedicate two weeks to the trip. The costs is the same for everyone if you stay less than two weeks. The first week will be used to discover the routes and get used to riding real hills. For those interested, the second week we will race. There is a Rondo race which&nbsp; some 150km including some "hills" and can take about 8 hrs. We can also race UCI style races in CAT3 or better. I think it would be something to return home and say we raced in France, but there is not requirement to do that. If you just want to watch, great. We may also look into ride one of the tour routes with the help of a driver for support. We will do what the group wants.<br /><br />I would expect everyone on the trip to be able to ride at least 28-30km/h+ on the flats. If you want to race, you will need a current UCI racing license or have past experience racing. I am not going to France to putter around. While we will ride to coffee shops, it will be always at a moderate to fast pace. We should see an increase in fitness on our return. I want this to be the last time I ride France and find myself at the mountain top before everyone else.<br /><br />Everyone that has a Garmin 705/800 must buy the european maps. The rides are already mapped out and appear on mapmyride.com. Without a garmin, you will be using paper maps. While we will stick together on group rides, you may way to do some riding on your own to push the pace or join a ride in the afternoon that is harder/faster. Rides will be unsupported. There are cafes in most towns, so it is nothing to be able to ride from town to town for water/coffee. <br /><br />For climbing into the mountains, we will hire a driver/car. This will be an added expense, but the ride into the mountains is 170km long and the weather at 2000m can be very unpredictable (it was 5C on the mountain top when I went in July 2011). This ride includes two Col climbs. 15km is the first one. The second is 10km. The car will carry our spare clothing, water, and food. Other than the mountain climb day, expect to bring your own food/water or be able to buy it en route. There will be no support vehicle.<br /><br />Expect rides to be between 50-180km starting at 9AM and last to 1-6pm depending on distance and the number of mountains/hills climbed. Rides in France just take longer because of the hills. If you were used to riding 90km in three hours here in Ontario, you can expect it to take 4-5 hour there. <br /><br />LINK: <a target="_blank" title="Example Mountain Ride " href="http://classic.mapmyride.com/ride/france/limoux/377131041783130868">Example Mountain Ride </a><br />LINK: <a target="_blank" title="Time Trial Route" href="http://classic.mapmyride.com/ride/france/limoux/818131071498294694">TIME TRIAL ROUTE</a><br /><br />ACCOMMODATION:<br /><br /><a target="_blank" title="Kiwi House France" href="images/kiwihouse_france.pdf">LINK: PDF FILE OF THE HOUSE</a><br /><br />The first house is 21 rue des Oules, Limoux and has 6 rooms each with a single bed, desk, lamp. One room has a double bed and I am reserving that for myself since I am putting the trip together. There are two bathooms which we share. It has a full kitchen with two fridges. Beyond the one couple that has expressed interest, the house really isn't suited for any more. More than seven people in the house will have us tripping over each other. Bikes hang in the kitchen on the wall. <br /><br />The second house&nbsp;46 Blanquérie, Limoux is under renovations this winter and will feature three rooms with two single beds in each. It has a kitchen and at bathroom. Photos are forthcoming from the owner. This house is special in that it has a large area to store bikes and bike boxes. It is a good place to build your bike when you arrive. The layout is as follows:<br /><br />- Top floor one room air conditioned with 3 beds – one double and two singles with its own bathroom&nbsp; so good for three singles 
  
  <div>
    &nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    - Second floor one room with two beds and one room with a double bed,&nbsp;&nbsp; so good for a couple and two singles.&nbsp; Bathroom shared (air conditioning in the room with two beds)
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    - Main floor (as before) a bunk bed , so two singles - although, I'm inclinded to keep this room to one person. It's small and a bunk bed is a pain to get in/out of.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    &nbsp;<br />While the second house can hold nine people, we are only selling six spots, unless a couple would like to share a room. The livingroom and kitchen are small and it will get crowded quickly.
  </div>
  
  <br />Both houses have a large livingroom with Satelite TV and free WIFI. Everything in Limoux is in walking distance. There is a Walmart style store a 30min walk/10min ride&nbsp; on the edge of Limoux. Food is either bought locally and made in the kitchen, or a short walk to places in the town square for things like fine french food to american style fries.<br /><br />A backpack for food shopping makes things easier unless someone decides to rent a car.<br /><br />COSTS<br /><br />The houses are 2600EU for two weeks or about $3800CND. Split 12 ways that is about $315 each. Airport transfer is about 200EU for the group each way. So, the total costs for two weeks is about $450. The cost of hiring a car/driver is on top of this amount, and will be split by anyone doing the ride that requires such.<br /><br />I do not intend to make money from the trip, just charge what it costs to cover the expenses. I will look after the house rental and <a href="http://www.aerobus-hautevallee.com/" title="Airport Transport" target="_blank">airport transport arrangements</a>, everything else will be up to group.<br /><br />Food costs are about $100-150 for two weeks if we eat in and at that rate, we are eating like kings. Everyone will be expected to chip in at shopping. I took 300EU with me in July 2012, and I had money left over.<br /><br />I have placed a deposit on the house to hold it. Given the tour is in town, everything will be booked by the end of October. Good luck arranging seeing the tour on your own.<br /><br />Update: As of Jan 25, the costs are $383.92 per person which includes accomodation in Limoux, transport for each person including bikes to and from the airport. Accomodation in Paris has to be arranged and will be shared. Most of the group is staying until Wednesday, July 25 although some are leaving on Monday, July 25.<br /><br /><span><span>GETTING THERE<br /><br />It cost me about $1200 for a return flight through AirFrance and $75 each way for the bike box. Do not think you can rent any kind of useful bike there. They are all crap. The flight was from Toronto to Paris and then Paris to Toulouse. If you think you can get a cheaper flight, be prepared to pay up to $300 each way for the bike box. Keep that in mind when booking your flight. If the group wants, we can use the same travel agent to book the flights so everything is easy. You will need to show up at the airport within a small time window for the airport transfer to occur. Otherwise, you are on the hook for a 220EU cab ride out of your own pocket.<br /><br />Currently, Air France is offering round trip flights to Toulouse for $1572CND. Flight leaves Toronto on Fri. July 6 at 6:45pm and arrives in Toulouse the next day at 11:45am. This puts us at the house about 3pm. Return trip leaves Limoux on Sun. July 21 at 10:50am and arrives in Toronto at 4:05pm the same day. You may optionally wish to remain in Paris on the Sunday, but that is up to you. You can store your bike box at the Paris Airport for 30EU and take a train into the city.<br /><br />One option would be to check out of Limoux on the Satuday, July 21, fly to Paris, and check into a hotel or an apartment. On the Sunday, we would watch the final stage of the tour and either fly out from Paris that night or the next day. Hotels in the area start around 140EU. There are apartments for rent that would hold the whole group if we are interested. For example: <a href="http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/236870" title="Large Apartment" target="_blank">LINK TO LARGE APT</a>. Costs for that would be about $160ea if we do an apartment. We would leave out bikes at the Paris Charles de Gualle airport in Left Luggage (<a href="http://www.aeroportsdeparis.fr/ADP/Resources/d6890b38-bc53-4595-a9c1-81ff36a5c8fc-CPleftluggageservice.pdf" title="Rates for Left Luggage" target="_blank">LINK TO RATES</a>). Personally, if we are going to France, I think we should all do Paris for the tour and for the sites.<br /><br />If you are interested in this trip, please contact mark at buckaway dot ca. I expect we will have a get together at a pub in the fall and again before the trip so there are no surprises during the trip.<br /><br />If it matters, I've been to the UK once and France twice with my bike, so I have an idea of what to expect. I am sure there are other far more experienced, but if this would be your first time, you will be in good hands.<br /><br />Jan 25 Update:<br />In order to facilitate airport transport, you will be expected to be standing outride airport in Tourlouse by 3PM on July 7 and ready to leave Limoux on July 22 at 10:30AM. If you book you flights and cannot make these times, you will be on your own. Most of the group is using the following flights. The only difference will be the return flight from France. You can take the RER or a cab to the airport with the group or on your own.<br /><br /></span></span>
