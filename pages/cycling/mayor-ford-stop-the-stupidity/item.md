---title: Mayor Ford: Stop the stupidityvisible: true---I know by posting this message, I'm going to get some flack. I do not care. Too many people want too much of my tax money spent on the wrong things. Today, I discovered the bike lane on Jarvis St is going to be removed. On riding down Jarvis St this morning, I was filmed for a few blocks by a CTV cameraman while I rode. All this hopla over bike lanes prompted me to email the mayor with my discust over the bike lane instructure plans. The email was as follows:

I am a local cyclist and car driver and Toronto tax payer. I gave up driving to work when I started working in downtown Toronto this year and took to my bike as a cheaper way into the core of the city. I ride from Leslie and Sheppard, some 20km one way, and back each day to Richmond and University. I do not support the pinko cyclist movement of the Toronto Cyclist Union. They do not represent me. What can I say, I own some six bikes and some of them worth more than my car. I would personally like to have a blue button to wear to slam the pinko cyclists.   
  
When I read that the City of Toronto is planning on removing bike lanes and install more, I have to wonder where the money is coming from. I voted for the Ford campaign on your wanting to stop the gravy train. I am probably the only cyclist that thinks this way, but it seems silly to spend money on bike lanes removal and installation especially when some of the roads are so pot hole invested they are almost impassible. A good example is River St. The road/bike lane is so rough it is like riding through the dirt trails of the Don Valley. There are many other examples.   
  
My point: I would like to see the current bike infrastructure frozen and the roads fixed before more money is spent/wasted on additional bike lanes and ripping out bike lanes. IF in the process of rebuilding the roads, a bike lane makes sense, great - otherwise, I am happy to ride on the road as I have always done.

I don't expect a response from the Mayor Ford's office. Maybe I am being elitest. No, I am being elitest. Bike I ride a bike faster than most cyclists on the road and in some cases I can keep up with car traffic. I do not support bike lanes for the most part other than in the downtown core. I do not support the city spending money it does not have on new bike lanes and removing old ones when the "extra" money is seems to be able to find would be better spent elsewhere.
