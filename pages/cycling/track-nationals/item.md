---title: Track Nationalsvisible: true---With track nationals almost upon us, I'm getting ask what events in which I will be participating, nevermind constantly being told to FOCUS. I gather people are looking to me for some good results considering I won a race against none other than Steve Bauer on the Forest City Velodrome a few weekends ago.

So, for those interested, tickets for the "show" at the Milton Velodrome are free. You can get them at this link: <a title="Tickets to Nationals" href="http://www.toronto2015.org/CNC-MIC-test-event" target="_blank">Tickets to Nationals</a>.

The tech. guide for the event is available here (which contains the details of the times): <a title="Tech Guide" href="http://www.cyclingcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CNC_TechGuide_FINAL_Dec51.pdf" target="_blank">Tech Guide</a>

The events run from Jan. 3 through to Jan 6. I will be competing in the following events:

**Sat. Jan 3**: No events, but I will be riding on the track from 1-3:30pm.

**Sun. Jan 4**:

Morning: Sprint Qualifying (Flying 200m TT). I have no change of qualifying, but I want a flying lap time for a 250m track to be able set a baseline. The second benefit is I get to train in the morning working on going fast on the track.

Afternoon: TT? There is some Masters TT final in the afternoon. 750 TT most likely.

**Mon. Jan 5**: This is where the fun begins. If you are getting tickets, these are the events you need to come and see.

Morning: Masters 40 lap Scratch race.

Afternoon: Masters 60 lap Points race. So, that is 6 sprints. I need to win 4.

**Tues. Jan 6**:

Morning: Keirin - this is one of the most fun races one can see/do. I am one of the few masters in Ontario to have done one before so it could be interesting.

Afternoon: 3K Individual pursuit

Get tickets for the Monday events. They are free and well worth it.
