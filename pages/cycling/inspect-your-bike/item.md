    Yesterday, I decided to get on my bike and ride into downtown Toronto to the office. The night before I inspected my bike for things like tire pressure and gear adjustments and moved my lights onto the bike I intended to ride. I saw my hand pump sitting on a shelve and my seatpost bag on another bike and thought, I should probably install them, just in case.

    Needless to say, I was glad I did. I got a flat somewhere between entering the office and leaving the office. Because I attached my bike bag to the bike, I had a spare tube. Because I attached the pump, I had something to pump up the tire. Having the pump was a plus because my CO2 cylinder was empty - I put the used one back in the bag last summer. I had to hand pump the tire up to pressure.

    Now, I work steps away from a bike shop, so it would have not been the end of the world, but I am making a point. Because you head out for a spring time ride, check you have the esscentials to fix a flat and a bike tool to adjust things that may have become loose or need find tuning. I had to stop on my ride home to re-adjust my gears, so anything is possible.

    Lesson: Inspect your bike before you ride and make sure you can fix minor issues by carrying the right tools. If you don't want to do it, take it your local bike shop and have a pro do it.
