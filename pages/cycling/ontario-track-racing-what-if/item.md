---title: Ontario Track Racing: What if....visible: true---Over the long September weekend, I spend my time racing at the International Velodrome at Bloomer Park at the Thunder Games track race. I've done that race two years in a row, although, last year I was less successful. I have also raced in Cleveland at the Cleveland Velodrome. I race in the US in the summer on the track because there isn't any track racing in Ontario. The Thunder Games was a two evening event that featured Madison racing at it's core. Teams raced against each other in scratch, points, and elimination races as well as a Madison for points. The top team wins the tournament. They eventually race a A and B group and I won the B group with Enrico "CritBoy" Traini as my partner. It was a blast. Looking at the videos on Youtube of the big track races in the UK such as the Revolution UK series, I get excited. Then, you come back to Ontario, and the excitement all goes away.

There used to be this style of racing at the Forest City Velodrome, but in recent years, the turn out for race nights as dwindled. While the FCV is about to undergo a transformation and a 6 day style show could happen this season but one has to wonder where Milton fits in. One has to wonder the possibilities of what could be and what isn't happening. Oddly, on the way back home from Bloomer Park, I had to wonder what if we do that format for a big race in Milton. What about the OCUP series, you say?
