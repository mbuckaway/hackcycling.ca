---title: Pearls of Wisdomvisible: true---<div>
  As I recovery from my broken collar bone from the crash in the Tour de Terra Cotta race on the August long weekend (yea, a month ago), I've had time to reflect on how I got to where I am. Of course, it helps to be asked by the Heart and Stroke Foundation for my story and, now, Bicycling Magazine has asked for the same. I also have friends, that while cyclists, still struggle to lose that last 10-25lbs. I thought I would offer some of the "Pearls of Wisdom". The basis premise of this post is you have to make diet, exercise, and training a habit - something that requires little thought, but is something you just do.<br /><br /><strong>Exercise as a Habit</strong><br /><br />First, my transformation from a fat guy at 265lbs to my now 185lbs frame didn't happen overnight. It happened mainly because of my desire to change which lead to the creation of new habits. There are a lot of diet and exercise programs out there that claim to be a quick fix. There is no quick fix. It takes time and a lot more than will power. When I started in the dead of winter back in 2008, I bought a trainer for my mountain bike, set it up in the basement, and told myself I would do 20 mins every morning before work on weekdays. I got up 30mins earlier to get ready and on the bike. I never missed a day. Before long, it became second nature to get up, change into the bike shorts, go to the basement, and spin for 20 mins. I have to admit some mornings I didn't want to get up, and after 20 mins I was completely wiped, but I kept at it. But, my rewards was I was losing weight.&nbsp;Eventually, 20 mins in the morning led to 30 min rides outside in the morning. 5km in 30 mins. Eventually, those rides got longer. 8km. 10km. 15km. I had to start riding after work because I ran out of time in the morning. Eventually, I hooked up with a friend and we started riding "long" regularly. Our longest ride was 60km. A new road bike soon followed as did joining a bike club. That was 2008. This past weekend I rode some 300km including 80km in Blue Mountain, ON - some of the longest hills in Ontario - all with a partially broken collar bone because I just can't stand to sit still anymore.<br />

  <br />It all started with the drudgery of a 20 min ride in the morning 5 days per week. It wasn't long before it became fun. I started a new habit of exercise. I could challenge myself to go longer, faster, harder. The habit became something I enjoyed doing, which in turn, made me want to ride more. This past spring, I rode 322km from Toronto to Niagara Falls in one day. I have ridden the mountains in France the last three summers in a row. I am going into my third year of bike racing. All because I started riding 20 mins per day. I made it fun.<br /><br /><strong>Diet as a Habit</strong><br /><br />One of the bigger challenges is making a new diet a habit. Exercise is one step, but too many people end up eating more simply because they are working out. Or worse, they won't fuel up properly on a ride. Diet change is a habit that take a long time to foster any sort of change. There are so many temptations. Food today is engineered to taste good. We have time pressures that we never work around. All these problems lead to a failure of the diet change - which is why making diet an unbreakable habit is so important. For me, I read numerous books and blogs on health eating to the point that when I hired a coach and asked for a diet plan, I was already mostly doing what he suggested.<br /><br />When I started, I wanted to what I was currently eating. For one or two days per week, I wrote down EVERYTHING I ate and drank. I estimated the calories of each item, I looked them up on the Internet, or read the package label. I added 20% for error. I always found that I under-estimated the calories of on a day and added 20% helped with anything I may have forgotten. Know that the average human requires 2000cals/day to operate. Any more, and it goes to fat. Any less and you lose fat, or lose energy (get tired). The notion of calories in/calories out applies. Yes, it is as simple as that. When I start logging what I ate, I found that a new habit formed of looking at the calorie count on the labels - which will lead to utter shock to the amount of calories that are in some foods that I loved....and how quickly 2000cals/day adds up. I used to eat a entire pack of cookies at my desk at work at 1000cals/package. No wonder I was overweight back then and getting fatter.<br /><br />My diet habit consist of a schedule:
</div>

  * First thing after getting up in the morning, breakfast. Cereal, Oatmeal, French Toast, Eggs/Toast, Omelette, Fruit and Yogurt, etc.. Never the same thing. Breakfast is the most important meal, and it can't be the same thing day in and day out. Make sure any carbs are mixed with protein. A begal at the office is not breakfast. Breakfast is eaten at home.
  * 10am-ish - snack time. Eat a piece of fruit with yogurt, an apple, etc. Something small and low in calories.
  * noon-ish - Lunch. Pasta, Peanut butter/Jam sandwich, salad - all home made. Bring your lunch to work. Avoid the temptations at a restaurant.
  * 2-3pm-ish - snack time. Same as 10am, but eat something different. Variety is important.
  * 5-6pm-ish - dinner time. This is the main meal of the day. I _ALWAYS_&nbsp;eat dinner before any evening workout, even if that means bringing dinner to work. Combine some form of protein with vegetables, pasta, etc.

<div>
  With the routine came a set of rules, that I have because a habit to me: 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Eat a variety of foods. I never eat the same thing day in and day out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Eat smaller portions. 16oz steak? Not. Try 4oz.
    </li>
    <li>
      Desert is not part of any meal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Fast food is for fat people. Period. Steak was never meant to be ground up with added fat and put on a bun. Fries are evil. Sugary soft drinks have no value unless you just completed a 160km bike ride. Drink water, not diet soft drinks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Pre-packaged anything is bad for you. Make it yourself. Pre-packaged food tastes REALLY GOOD because food scientists are employed to make it that way to sell more crap to you. I was brought up on home cooked meals, so avoiding frozen pizza, etc. was a simple of matter of planning in advance. I now can cook a complete meal in 30 mins.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drink water. Lots of it. Stay away from fruit juices - while they may be "good for you", they are high in calories. I bought a carbonator to put some fizz in my water because I can't stand plain water.
    </li>
    <li>
      If the first ingredient of anything you buy is sugar or any derivative of it, put it back. Again, the read the label habit helps with this idea.
    </li>
    <li>
      Diet anything is for fat people. Diet products usually stimulate the hunger response that makes you eat more. What's the point of that?
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep some hard candies handy. Werther's are 20cals/each and I use one of them when I just need the taste of sugar. It beat a trip to the coffee shop for that muffin I didn't really need.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drink Tea instead of the Moccafrappabambinochino coffee blend thing at you local $5/cup coffee shop. I was shocked at the calorie count of some of these drinks. Furthermore, add up how much you spend on these coffees per month to be shocked in other ways.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have to eat out, understand that most American style restaurants put enough food on the plate for two or three people. You do not have to finish it. No children in Africa starved because I didn't clean my plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Throw out the 12" plates. I use 8" plates at home. You will feel you are eating more when you are not on the smaller plates.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always eat at the table, preferably with family - NEVER in front of the TV. TV makes you eat more because you are not paying attention to eating.
    </li>
    <li>
      Exercise is not a license to overeat. I eat normally after a long ride. I also eat while on the ride which makes the eating after a long ride more normal. Fat people try to lose weight by not taking in any calories on a ride.
    </li>
  </ul>

    These are some other rules I follow. There are a lot more. Too many to share here. Michael Pollan's <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Food-Rules-Eaters-Michael-Pollan/dp/014311638X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346892416&sr=1-1" title="Food Rules" target="_blank">Food Rules</a>&nbsp;is the basis for a lot of my diet rules. I didn't develop them overnight, but they came over time as I learned to eat healthy. For the most part, they are practiced completely out of habit. It's just something I do. Most people fail at a change in diet because a diet needs to be a new habit that must be formed and new habit formation usually takes time.<br /><br /><strong>Training as a Habit</strong><br />&nbsp;

  Once I got to the point of riding indoors on my own on the trainer for 2.5 hours in front of the TV playing some kind of cycling interval video and taking indoor cycling classes, I decide it was time to hire a coach. He introduced me to the notion of structured interval training and strength training. This meant finding time for 15-20/hrs week riding and working out. I have to admit, it wasn't much of a stretch. I had more or less given up on TV watching some years prior when I starting taking University courses, now I just gave up on it entirely. The average person wastes 20+ hours/week in front of the idiot box. I can't remember the last time I did that. In fact, &nbsp;I can't recall the last time I actually had cable or satellite TV. I replaced my TV watching with workouts and I never looked back. When I crashed out of the race a month ago, and couldn't ride, I was completely lost at what to do with all that spare time.<br /><br />My current habit is looking at the Training Peaks email in the morning to figure out the evening's workout. I get home from work, I eat dinner, and do the workout. Some nights it's drudgery. Some nights it's not. But because I've got it so ingrained in what I do, I just to do it. I feel guilty if I miss a workout. That good feeling after a workouts is addictive. It supports the habit loop and always makes me feel good. &nbsp;I also know that the benefits of a workout are something that are not always immediately apparently. It is part of a longer term solution to get faster, go harder.<br /><br />In my case, what started as a intervals to get faster and keep up with group rides, that lead to the want to get into bike racing, which fuel my need for harder workouts, my need to get faster, etc.. Training developed into a self-perpetuating&nbsp;habit loop.<br /><br /><strong>Life as a Habit</strong><br /><br />Long term change such as dropping from 265lbs to 185lbs, or picking up a new sport such bike racing is not something that happens overnight. It takes time. I changed because I made everything I did a new habit. I started small and built on the new habits until they became second nature. I didn't picking up exercising after 40 years of having difficulty getting off the couch, eating properly, or wanting to race faster/harder by suddenly deciding one New Years Day it was going to happen. I created new habits.<br /><br />
  
  <hr />
  While I developed these habits on my own without knowing about the concept of the habit loop - I knew I needed to change - Charles Duhiggs' book "
  <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Power-Habit-Why-What-Change/dp/0385669747/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346895116&sr=1-1" title="The Power of Habit" target="_blank">The Power of Habit</a>" basically explains how I unknowingly used changing habits to change my life. It's a good start for anyone that wants to understand how to effect lasting change.<br /><br />&nbsp;
