---title: Goals for the Season completedvisible: true---It is about 11am on a Saturday and I sit at the computer typing rather than being out on the second last scheduled club ride. It was somewhat strange to not get up at 6:45am to prepare for the ride, but after this week, I feel complete. I have completed the goals which I set for myself this fall. The goals changed significantly after my crash in June, but I set out in the hospital some goals that I thought were achievable:

1) Get out and ride with the club in October and keep up with them. October, I thought would be the soonest I would be able to ride.

2) Ride to the office and back (58km one way).

When I was given the go ahead to put full weight on my leg in the first week of September, I immediately jumped on the bike on the trainer. I could move the pedals around seated and I promised myself that I would only move outside when I could get the pedals around standing and that happened some 5 days later. While I could not get the pedals around faster than 80RPM, I grabbed my son on September 12, and took the bike out for a 8km spin. I took my son with me in case something happened. He would be there to call in the calvary. I will never forget the first time getting back on the bike on the road. I was shaky and need to re-learn how to balance myself. True be told, it was probably rather soon to be riding but I did it anyways. I had grown tire of sitting around doing nothing. It did not take long on that ride to be faster than my son. While I never really went faster than 20km/h, he could not keep up with me and I had to wait for him several times. That ride was the confidence booster I needed. The next day, I set out on a 20 km route on my own and I did it. Later in the week, I did 30km. On the weekend, I planned a 55km ride with my friend Ron and I did that. We did some hills which I managed to make it up. The following week I went to Peterborough with the wife and did a 40km ride through some rolling hills. I can recall hitting some 9% hills and struggling to get up them, but I managed to do it. I still could not walk without a crutch at this point, but I could ride. September 26 I believe was the first group ride I did with the club. It was a week earlier than I had planned because my friend Ron bailed on me. I wanted to take it slow to start, but I managed to keep up with the group on that club ride and I was thankful that the ride leader put a "Drop no one" policy on the ride. However, the ride was not that had and tackled no hills, so I did not have much difficulty keeping up.

Since then I have ridden once per week (total 4-5 club rides) on a Saturday. I have struggled on hills and had to re-learn the rules of riding long: eat and drink before you need it. I almost bonked on one ride because I did not eat enough along the way. I kept to a limit of one long ride per week although I did get out on my own for some rides less then 30km to keep the calories burning. The XRays in October showed my leg was still fractured, so I thought riding too much would be a bad idea; although, most people wondered why I was riding at all. Hell, I could ride better than I could walk....and this still applies today.

The last goal was to get on the bike and ride to work and back. Work is in Oakville and home is in Scarborough. This week I completed that goal. Wednesday was warm enough that leg and arm warmers became optional. It rained on the way home, but not enough to actually get wet. It was a great experience. I did the 58km ride to the office in 2hr 6 mins moving time which was 7 minutes longer than my best time which I did before the crash. The ride home was a bit longer (2hr 15 mins), but I encountered traffic and the ride from the down by Lake Ontario to home is all up hill. Considering I was still riding with a fractured femur, a right leg that has no muscular strength, and can not sprint more than 750W (my max was 1300W in June), methinks this is quite an accomplishment.

Thus, I feel complete. I have accomplished my goals for the season. While I wonder how far I may have come if I did not crash in June, I look at the crash as a learning experience in that I was give time to think about my goals and I move forward a bit more slowly. I had thought I could do the Ontario Cup series in the coming year, but as a novice cyclist, methinks that would be better done in year three. I will take my time getting faster and use the coming year to get back into learning to race again, build on race experience, and work on bike handling skills.
