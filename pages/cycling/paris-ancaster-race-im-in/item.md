---title: Paris-Ancaster Race: I'm invisible: true---Don't Stop Jim has suggested once or twice that he has registered for a one day event in Paris, ON. <a href="http://www.parisancaster.com/" target="_blank">Paris-Ancaster</a> is called a road race; although, only part of it is on the road. A fair amount is actually off-road (single track trails) and on dirty roads. The race is for Cross and Mountain bikes, but the registration page lists a few other categories: Tandem and Unicycle. I could only image what it would be like riding 60KM offroad on a Unicycle.

The race is in Mid-April which is a good time to test the racing skills for the coming season. Given my racing career hit the pavement last summer and put it on hold, this 60KM race seems like a good attempt to test the fitness level. Apparently, the average finish time is around 3 hours. It will be interesting mingling with seasoned racers and beginners. The race is targeted at all levels.

For 60KM, 3 hours seems kind of slow, considiring the crits I have done the average speeds hit 35km/h+. But after watching a few videos from YouTube, I can see why the race takes that long. For a season mountain biker, this course will be easy. The race has large offroad seactions that have a fair amount of Cross type challenges. For someone like myself, that has rarely riden offroad, some of these sections might present a challenge; however, the on road sections will test my race skills.

I plan to register this evening when I can be in the same room as my UCI license.
