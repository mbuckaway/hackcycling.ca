---title: Nationals TTvisible: true---I did the National TT on Thrusday. It was a good chance to test my skill on the course that I rode twice before; expect, this time I would be racing against some of the best 40-49 Masters Men in Canada. The wind was whipping against us on the back stretch and I have an issue with the word recovery going through my mind at hard points in the ride. I was passed by two other riders on the course, so I knew I would not be at the top of the standings.

However, I placed 23rd of 27 in my category and achieved a time of 33'26" - which is almost one minute thirty seconds better than my best time of 35'. Of course, the best rider on the course managed the course in under 29'. It was a good experience. I didn't do the Nationals Crit or Road Race because I would be racing M1-M3 class riders in my age group, and I didn't want to blow the $60 entry fee to get blown off the back of the pack on the first few laps.

Here is a photo of the TT:
