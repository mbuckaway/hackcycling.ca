---title: Riding in Exeter, UKvisible: true---I flew over the pond to stay with my friend Roger in Exeter, Devon, UK. I brought my bike with me. The idea was to test out flying with the bike before I go to France in September and to get some exposure to riding in Europe.

I can say that riding in the English countryside is far different the riding around the "big" city of Toronto. While Toronto is only about one quarter (or less) the size of London, it still takes 45-60 mins to get clear of the city on a bike to get to roads without much traffic. Then, those roads are mostly straight. Toronto was laid out in a grid pattern with most roads going east/west or north/south. There are some hills, but grades over 7% are rare and hills up to 15% require some searching. In Ontario, one must drive about two hours north of Toronto to ski country to get to roads with long steep grades.&nbsp;

In Exeter, it took about 15 minutes on a bike to get out of town. We are out in the English countryside. Now, I had rode twice on my own while I was there to make sure could remember to ride on the left side of the road and navigate the blind corners and the twisty roads before I joined the local club ride. While my friend Roger warned me there are hills, I never expected the hills I did find. The entire area is built around a few river valleys. One must climb from one river valley to the next over hills the resemble small mountains. Grades of 10% are typical. Grades up to 13-17% are easy to find.

On the Sunday (July 11, 2010) I joined the <a title="Exeter Wheelers Cycling Club" href="http://www.exeterwheelers.co.uk" target="_blank">Exeter Wheelers Cycling club</a> for their club ride. Most of the riders in our club try to visit clubs when they travel so they are riding with people that are familiar with the area. For me, I would have been completely lost if it were not for my Garmin 705 GPS. I can see the seven guys that came up to their club ride were fast. Some Cat 2 and Cat 3 riders were in the group. They know how to ride. I have to say, that at one point, I did crash. We were flying down a hill (really, a slight grade) and there was some discussion with the club members as to whether we were to turn at the next road. Well, they decided to turn at the last second. I was about 2 secs too far ahead to actually turn, but attempted it anyways. I then ran into some gravel and failed to navigate the turn and landed (softly) in the bushes on the side of the road. I was lucky because a lot of the bushes, apparently, hide brick walls. There was no harm done, but I should have kept going straight rather than turn. It did take much then to decide that these guys just know how to ride better because of the terrain they have to deal with on a regular basis. Our flat roads make us too comfortable. There is nothing here to present a challenge. I can see why North American cyclists say that one must go to Europe to train.

It was a fun ride with the Exeter Wheelers. We did 132km with a pace of 29.4km/h average for the ride. For the most part, I managed to keep up; although, I came prepared for a three hour ride and we were out for 4.5 hrs, so I started to fade at one point near the end of the ride. Live and learn. Come prepared to ride longer methinks should be my mantra.
