---title: My new bikevisible: true---I got a new bike this week. It is a fixed gear bike I got custom made at Urbane Cycle in Downtown Toronto. I rode it home today from the downtown core up Yonge St to force myself to ride in traffic and get used to starting and stopping on the road with a fixed gear bike. I plan to ride the fixie in foul weather and any day I don't have to be at the Midweek Crit or TT. It was a good ride home; although, it took 20 mins longer because of all the traffic and stop lights.

The specs:&nbsp;Urbane Cyclist 54cm solid steal fixed gear bike

  * 25mm tires on Mavic rims
  * 144 track style 165mm cranks (so it uses the same parts are my track bike) with 44 tooth spocket
  * Flip flop hub with 18 tooth cogs both sides
  * Drop bars (nice heavy alloy ones)
  * Road style brakes with brake hoods (good place to put ones hands)

The bike handles well and is very useful in traffic. One doesn't have to worry about jumping for the brakes...the pedals give the rider full control over the motion. I can see why bike couriers ride fixed gear bikes. Of course, I looked like a knob with my roadie gear on.

I am however glad that I got brakes. When flying down a hill the likelihood of a controlled stop is small. This is not an issue in the downtown core, but up here in the north part of the city it is. Brakes are also useful at stop lights to stay stopped. I am also happy I got a 44/18 gearing. While 62 gear inches is tiny for the track, it is good for casual outdoor riding. That gearing means 90rpm on the cranks yields 28km/h. I would be struggling on some of the 5-7% grades I had to tackle if I got anything bigger. I would put the 46 on or switch to a 15/16 on the back to do the donut ride. The bigger gears would be needed for speed.

The only thing missing: fenders!I To save getting splashed in wet conditions. While I still have to fiddle with bike fit, it is all good.&nbsp;
