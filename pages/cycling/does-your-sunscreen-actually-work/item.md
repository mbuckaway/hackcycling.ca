---title: Does your sunscreen actually work?visible: true---The Environmental Working Group, in the US, evaluated some 1400 sunscreens for their effectiveness. They found a surprising few actually work as promised. Most do not protect against UVA. UVB protection is regulated by the FDA by UVA protection is not. A lot popular sunscreens contain concinigens which are hazardous to your health.

Because of the usage patterns of most people, they find that a SPF50 sunscreen really is around 3. They find most people use only about 1/4 of the required amount.

This is a good report to go through considering as a cyclist, you are outside in the heat of the sun for long hours and sweat off sunscreen.&nbsp;
