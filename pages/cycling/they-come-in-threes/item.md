---title: They Come in Threesvisible: true---<div>
  They say all good things come in threes. Well, it happened this week.<br /><br />Saturday night I raced the Forest City Velodrome and won my first race ever. I got to carry the Canadian flag for a victory lap. The race was Last Man Standing. So, from a standing start, I have to go all out to catch the rider in front of me and go over him. I marked him from the start, and told myself I needed to give 110% to not get lapped myself. I kept giving 110%. Last Man Standing is an all out sprint until its over. When it was two of us left on the track, it took all I could to attempt to sprint past the guy, but I just couldn't go it. I had to wait for him to burn out (or give up)....which happened, but not after some 5-6 laps of trying. It took 10 mins afterwards to recover from this race. However, I managed to win.<br /><br />Saturday morning, I met with Julian of Vitess. He helped build up my Vitess Red and replaced the cables housings in white. I provided the new chain, bar tape, cables, etc. Julien built up the bike for me and did a quick check fit to make sure to the seat was set correctly. I broke the frame of this bike a while back and I am glad to have this bike back in action. I rode it this evening to break in the new cables. It is quite a difference from my Giant TCR Advanced 2.<br /><br />Lastly, today the new bike kit came in and I went over to collect it. I finally have a real TT Skin Suit. Check it out. I'm ready to race this season under the Real Deal Racing (ie. Ed Veal's Team) banner.<br /><br />
