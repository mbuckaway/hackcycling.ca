---title: Track 1 Course at FCVvisible: true---In order to ride the track at the Forest City Velodrome in London, ON, one must complete the track 1 course. This takes you through the various steps of getting comfortable on riding the track. With embankments of 50 degrees, this is important. One must be able to hold a speed of 32km/h in order to stay on the track (although, experienced riders can do 22km/h and still stay on it - but that requires some skill).

This video shows Robyn and Jim of the D'Ornellas Bike Club taking the track 1 course and some additional riding by myself at the end of the video. Check it out!
