---title: Are you committedvisible: true---<div>
  I received this document in email today. It is originally from companyfounder.com from <a href="http://www.companyfounder.com/2011/10/are-you-interested-or-are-you-committed/" title="Are you committed?" target="_blank">THIS BLOG POST</a>. It is relavent to many things, but if you ask yourself, "Are you committed to winning a bike race?", it is relavent to bike racing. If not racing to win, why bother?<br /><br />Here are seven of the key differences between being interested and being committed.
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      If you are interested, you show up sometimes. If you are committed, you show up all the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are interested, when things get tough, you give up and move on to your next "interest". If you are committed, no matter how tough things get, you find a way over, under, around or through obstacles.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are interested, you dabble in a bunch of interests. If you are committed, you concentrate your energy on achieving a much shorter list of objectives. In short, you focus.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are interested, you are easily distracted and often fall victim to shiny object syndrome. If you are committed, you are so focused that you often don't even notice the irrelevant shiny objects around you.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are interested, you don't set goals; rather, you just let it happen. If you are committed, you set goals in a way that maximizes the probability you will achieve them, and you regularly monitor your progress.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are interested, you let the fear of failure and other fears keep you from achieving your objectives. If you are committed, you realize that every "failure" is just another step in the direction of achieving your goals.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are interested, you allow perfectionism to inhibit your progress, working hand-in-hand with fear of failure to limit your success. If you are committed, you understand that perfectionism is the enemy and you continue to make forward progress, even if each step is not perfect.
    </li>
  </ol>Ask yourself, "Am I committed, or am I just interested"? If the answer comes back, "I'm not sure," or "I'm just interested," then unless it's a hobby that you can dabble in and take lightly, you need to reconsider where you are focusing your energy. As a friend once said to me, dabbling is a root cause of failure. You cannot afford to dabble or just be interested in the people and activities that are truly important in your life. Interest will usually get you nowhere. Commitment, on the other hand, has a much higher probability of delivering you the results you are seeking.
