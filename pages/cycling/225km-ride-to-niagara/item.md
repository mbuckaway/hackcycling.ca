---title: 225km ride to Niagaravisible: true---<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I have ridden to Niagara Falls twice this summer from home. My parents live there, so it is really a no brainer for me. I hope on my bike and ride door to door. The last time I did that it took 8 hours (6h35 moving time) and I averaged 32km/h on my own. I was lucky because the wind was on my back for most of the time and I was feeling really good that day.<br /><br />I would like to do it again. This time, I would like to get a group together. I think we can average 34km/h+ if we work together. I have reworked the route to add some 20km to it to incorporate the Rattlesnake point climbs and to go all the way up the Effingham hill. So, the ride is now 229km long with water stops about every 30-40kms after Hamilton - which I found necessary because of the heat I travelled in. Lunch break is in Ancaster. After the Hamilton mountain climb, it is a much needed break.<br /><br />My proposed route is the following:<br />

    Anyone interested in a long ride? August 20th I have set for a date. I would liked to have done the Provincial TT, on August 21, but I'm not ready for a 40km TT this year. For the long ride, the idea would be to leave about 8am from Toronto, and take the GO Train back from Niagara. The train leaves at 7:30pm and has a car specially designed for bikes. I suspect this ride will take 6.5-7hrs moving time up to about 9hours real time. I would arrange for backpacks to be transported to Niagara so everyone has dry clothes to wear on the train. Email me if interested.
