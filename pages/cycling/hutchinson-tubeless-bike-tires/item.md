---title: Hutchinson Tubeless Bike Tiresvisible: true---In reading the best products this year item from Popular Science, I ran across Hutchinson RoadTubeless bike tires. Apparently, they use a foam component to replace the tube. The tires are available for every type of bike including road, psychocross, etc.

Too bad they don't have any dealers in Canada or the US.
