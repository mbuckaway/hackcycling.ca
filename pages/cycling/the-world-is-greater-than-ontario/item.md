---title: Racing: More than Ontariovisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  When I started racing, I found one of the issues I had was finding out about the races. The Ontario Cycling Association does publish races held in Ontario, but folks, the world is bigger than that. Certainly, anyone willing to do some driving can be racing all over every weekend and sometimes during the week. There are also a lot of good racing opportunities in the US in MI and NY and in Canada in Quebec. A lot of racers in Ontario seem to think the only things that matters is OCUP races. If you didn't know it, you can apply the results from races outside Ontario for upgrade points towards your license. Racing something other than the "usual" races also opens up training opportunities one would otherwise not have and sometimes can be fun racing against guys that have no idea who you are.

  Today is Thursday, June 6. Last weekend the K/W Classic was held in Kitchener. The weekend before that was a road race in Frankenmooth, MI.

Today Ed Veal and the Real Deal guys are holding there Thursday Night Time trail (weather permitting). Simularly, the Buffalo Cycling Club is holding their Lankenville Challenge Crit in Downtown Buffalo (10 mins from the Peace Bridge). The Buffalo Crit runs rain or shine and is a four corner crit. It's tough. This weekend Ride for Randel is holding their stage race and the Buffalo Cycling Club is holding their Hamburg Race weekend. I'm in Hamburg on Sunday for the criterium.

  The following weekend we have the Horseshoe Centurion (Barrie area) and the Preston Street Crit in Ottawa.

  If you can't make a Real Deal TT on a Thursday night, check with the Newmarket Eagles Cycling Club because they run TT's of varying lengths on Tuesday nights.

  The Cleveland Velodrome in Cleveland, OH is holding their State championships the third weekend in June and race every thursday night. Anyone can participate, but obviously, only OH residents can get a metal/title. The International Velodrome at Bloomer Park in MI is almost done and will be holding Friday night racing. The Forest City Velodrome starts up again in Sept with racing Saturday nights.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The point I am trying to make there is more to racing than what appears on the Ontario Cycling Calender. If you are willing to do some driving, you can be racing several times per week.
