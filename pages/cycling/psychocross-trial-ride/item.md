---title: Psychocross trial ridevisible: true---This weekend in Toronto was unusually warm. On Saturday, it reached 15C. Today, Sunday it reached 19C. It was like a cool summer day, but for a fall day, it was down right balmy. One must consider that a few days ago, there was frost on the ground in the mornings. On one ride three weeks ago, we started in 1C weather. 1C is cold for a ride. This weekend was not only warm but sunny all weekend.

Of course, that meant riding outside was a must. On Saturday, I planned a 46km ride and kept going to end up doing 55km - all on my own. I had wished I checked with the club to see who was riding. I could have easily done a 90km ride with a group. With the wind from the south, the usual ride up the York/Durham 30 road was easy because the wind blew me up the road. Normally, the wind is from the north, and riding up the road is difficult; nevermind, it is all up hill. The ride home was harder because it was against the wind. I didn't care. It was warm and sunny enough that it was a pleasure riding. I got in a good workout.

Sunday, I had planned to get out the Cross bike. I have never ridden it off-road before. I have done some local runs with it on the road and find riding a cross bike on wet slippery roads far less scary than with the road bike with the smooth racing tires. I have never ridden in Cross races, but I am told that some call it psycho-cross for a reason: the people that ride it are nuts. How many people would take a modified road bike and ride it in the dirt, up hills, and in through water? Nevermind, one has to get off the bike and run with it on one's shoulder to get over obstacles. This seems like MTB territory.

So, today I planned to ride with my MTB buddy Ron. While we had planned to check out the Durham Forest, but we settled on riding in a woodlot near his home in Aurora. The woodlot contained some 3km of trails that were mostly single track with some dual track trails mixed in. He definitely had the advantage on his mountain bike, but the idea was to try and ride in the dirt. It took me a few rides around the lot to get the hang of riding on trails. I found I have a lot to learn. It is far scary riding in the woods than on the road. I did learn that the gearing on my cross bike is too high. The average cadence for the ride was 50RPM and some of the hills presented quite a challenge to get the pedals around. I also learned that flying over the handlebars is not as painful in the bush. I hit a depression in the leaves at speed (10km/h?) which caught the front wheel of the bike and literally threw me over the handlebars and I landed almost in front of the bike. Luckily, I landed on my left side (my ride leg is the one I fractured). Had that been pavement, that would have really hurt. My shoulder may have went crunch, but I was fine. We continued to ride. It is quite amazing how hard it is to actually ride on the trails on and one grass. It graps the tires of the bike and makes riding twice as difficult.

What seemed like a short period of time was actually about 1.5 hours. We did as much walking as riding and I got to find the position to shoulder my bike. While I did not feel that it was much of a workout, it took a few hours for the slow cadence work to settle into my legs and I felt like I rode for a few hours on the road bike. There were some hard climbs on the trail.

So, in order to ride cross, I need to do the following:

- get a 12-28 or better cassette for the machine

- fix the brakes on the bike - they are not tight enough

- leave the GPS unit and heart rate strap at home. When just riding around, this stuff is not useful.

Next time, I want to find trails on which we can get some speed and I have to learn to hop on and off the bike in a single motion.
