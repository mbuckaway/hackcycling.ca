---title: Do stop signs matter?visible: true---One of the comments a cyclist almost always gets is the lack of stopping at stop signs, especially during group rides. However, one has to wonder why cyclists are picked on when most drivers fail to stop as well. The notion of coming to a complete stop seems to be defeated in this rush-rush society. Of course, the city of Edmonton fixed the problem by replacing stop signs with yield signs and in Iowa, stop signs are yield signs for cyclists.

In Philadelphia, PA late last year, there was some hoop-la over scofflaw cyclists when two pedestrians were killed after being run into by cyclist. The politicians introduced new tougher laws to "teach" those evil cyclists. However, in Philly cars don't stop at stop signs either. Here is a Youtube video evidence:

One has to wonder if the same experiment were conducted in downtown Toronto, how many motorists (never mind cyclists), would stop at a stop sign.

As a motorist, I stop at all stop signs. As a cyclists, I treat them as yield signs only if there are on quiet streets. If there is a lot of traffic, I stop. I never roll through red lights.
