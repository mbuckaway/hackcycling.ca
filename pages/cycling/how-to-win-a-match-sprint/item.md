---title: How to win a Match Sprintvisible: true---<p style="text-align: justify;">
  When training at the track in London, ON over the winter, I foolishly asked what the point of the sprint was. The "wise" instructor told me the following: "To get across the finish line first". That was helpful. Of course, the Match Sprint in track is a cat and mouse game requiring chess like moves to outsmart your opponent. It is not always about who is faster. I have struggled to figure out the "rules" of how to win.
