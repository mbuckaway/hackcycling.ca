---title: Tour or Bronte: Another learning experiencevisible: true---Yesterday, I did the Tour of Bronte. Vitess Racing was present and I, and two other team members, rode in the race. It was to be my first "real" race of the season. I should probably be more upset about the outcoming, but I'm looking at it as a learning experience.

I've been having issues getting time to train properly because in my "wisdom", I decided to follow through with a University course I signed up for last year. The original intent was to do the course in the fall, but I discovered in sept, the course was in the winter. So, for the last three months, I've been trying to train for racing and studying at the same time. It has not been working well. My training and my studies have both suffered.

Tour of Bronte should have been a fairly easy race. My goal was to finish. I wanted it to be a hard training ride. I showed up with my Vitess bike and I was using my alloy wheels, 700x25c gater hard shell rides, and slime tubes. Flats weren't going to be an issue. I was mentally ready for a hard ride. I had done some hard rides on the morning glory ride and the donut ride. I was ready for the effort. I expected it to be hard. I had dome some practice riding rough roads hitting every pot hole. Obviously, I wasn't prepared enough.

About 60% through the first lap, I crossed the bridge in the course, and then about 10 meters past that point, for what seemed like no reason at all, my bike slide out from under me. I had been keeping up with the pack and pushing to the front. I hit the ground hard. But, I was in the pack, and the guy behind me ran completely over me. The guy behind him ran into him. We dusted ourserves off. I was trying to decide whether to get back on the bike and keep going. However, I noticed the seat stay broken. I was done. Nothing I could have done about it. I was more concerned that I caused the crash and about destroying the other guy's day that I was not out of a bike. It should never have happened. I am not sure what I could have done differently.

Of course, in hindsight, I think the following is true:

- Given my inexperience handling a road bike with skinny tires on gravel, I should have used my cross bike yesterday.

- Size 700x28C tires would have been better. Paris/Roubiuex riders were using them.

- During training, I will get out on dirt/gravel roads to train. In fact, I should do get out on gravel roads with a road bike anyways to improve my handling skills.

- Next year, I will ride the course the day before being both my cross bike and road bike and see which is better. I think I should also make it a requirement for race participation. My new rule of thumb. There is too much at stake to not be familar with the course. I can't afford to be replacing bikes. I can't afford to be off work. It hurts too much to crash.

So, when I think when it come to Springbank, I'll be out riding the course the day before. Next Sunday is Paris/Ancaster, but I've already done that race once. I'm inclinded to skip the Good Friday race given the crashes from last year and I'm down a bike anyways.
