  The question to ask is: Are you winning the workout or just showing up?<br /> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Level 1) You show up. You do the job exactly as you’re told to do it; nothing more, nothing less. You get a little better.
    </li>
    <li>
      Level 2) You show up. You do the job, and you target certain tasks that’ll help you toward your goal. You work the workout, push yourself, think about technique. You get a lot better.
    </li>
    <li>
      Level 3) You show up, having thought about how <span class="Object" id="OBJ_PREFIX_DWT526">today’s session fits into the larger goal. You work <em>very</em> hard, pushing yourself into the discomfort zone over and over, with full commitment. Later, you reflect/analyze/critique your performance with a cool, objective eye. You get a LOT better, creating what Gambetta calls “the quantum leap.”</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
