---title: Climbing Mont Ventouxvisible: true---The highlight of my trip to France in Sept/Oct. was the climb of Mt. Ventoux. There was much anticipation and anxiety over the climb from our group because it's supposed to be one of the toughest climbs in France. However, we spend about a week prior to the climb getting ready for it by climbing many a Col in the Pre-Alps region of Provence. So, but the time the big climb came around, we've done some 5000m or more of climbing on grades varying from 7% up to 11%. But like anything athletic, it is part physical and part mental. I would say the climb up Mt. Ventoux is more of a mental challenge because it is a matter of sitting in and grinding away for over 1.5 hours or more. I rode my Vitess Black Night up the mountain with a standard chainring set and a 11-28 cassette on the back. My cadence varied from 50RPM to 70RPM depending on the grade. Grades topped out at 13% in the tree section of the climb. What struck me as quite amazing is the average power for the ride was something like 275W and I spend some 45 mins in Zone 4 for heart rate. I pushed hard on the climb and didn't really realize it.

As I ride the track in London, ON, I am looking forward to the coming season and riding the hills of Collingwood/Blue Mountain and practice some of the things I learned climbing mountains in France.

Here is the video of the ascent of Mt. Ventoux:
