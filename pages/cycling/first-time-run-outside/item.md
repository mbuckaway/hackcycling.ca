This week has been a bit of a slow one from the point of exercise. My daughter has been in the hospital with food poisoning (she's ok), and I've spend a lot of the time at the hospital. While I still do my morning 30 min wake up core workout, I've not managed to get in the physio workout or get in a run on the trendmill. I've taking to running because it is a requirement for physio to get the muscles in my right leg (the leg I broke in June 2009) functioning correctly.

So, considering my daughter was not coming home was expected today, I took the opportunity to job to the hospital and back. $14 for parking was also an incentive. So, I drive home to make dinner for the family, and set out after dinner to run (jog, really) to the hospital and back. It was a whopping 3.5km one way, but because I am a beginner at running, I figured this distance was a good start. So far I've managed 60 mins on the trendmill for about 7km. Of course, being a cyclist, I have yet to learn up to dress in the cold for running. On the bike, wind is an issue. Dress to light, and the wind will blow right through you. Running, on the other hand, does not have such issues. So, I put on three layers on top and a single layer on bottom. I quickly discovered this many layers was too much. I would have ran in a long sleeve T-Shirt and baseball cap tonight. I would have been warm enough tonight because it was 0C out and the air was still. 20 mins into the run each way, and I was stripping off clothing.

The few times I've managed to get a run/job in I am astounded at one fact: running takes more muscles than cycling. I hurt in places I have never hurt before. However, it's worth it. My muscular endurance on my right leg has improved greatly. A 20 min walk around the mall caused my right leg muscles to get tired. This much no longer happens.

Thus, the first outside run felt good. I need to do it more often....and to get out for 1-2 hours.
