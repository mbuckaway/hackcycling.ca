---title: Rights of Passagevisible: true---In this months <a href="http://www.bicycling.com" target="_blank">Bicycling Magazine</a> is an excellent article on the <a href="http://bicycling.com/blogs/thisjustin/2009/10/12/rites-of-passage/" target="_blank">rights of passage of a cyclist</a>. While I'm only being cycling with any seriousness for about a year, a lot of the items in the article ring true.

Here are some of the ones I have started to know:

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; line-height: 18px;">02. You go from one pair of shorts to a dedicated drawerful.</span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; line-height: 18px;">07. Discovering how a convenience-store Coke can resurrect the dead.</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">08. Starting and finishing a ride—the same one—in pouring rain. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">14. You’re on the bike for the fifth straight day, and your butt doesn’t hurt. </span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">There are many other rights of passage that ring so true, but I think the best one comes from the comments section of the article on the website (from kp4155):</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">- Purchasing your first road bike and realizing your hybrid wasn’t as fast as you thought</span></span>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">- Staring at a new bike. Wishing you could afford the latest carbon technology</span></span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; line-height: 18px;">- Finishing a century and wanting to ride even further<br /></span>

<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; line-height: 18px;">- Not feeling embarrassed wearing cycling shorts</span>

<span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, Tahoma, San-serifs; color: #000000;"><span style="line-height: 18px;">That was me last year. Hybrid bike, fat guy XXXL cycling shorts that I liked to wear when riding (BTW, those are now way too big), and getting to ride a century and liking it. Of course, I jumped the gun and bought the latest carbon technology.</span></span>
