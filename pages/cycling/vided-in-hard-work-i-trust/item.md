---title: VIDED: In hard work, I trustvisible: true---<div>
  I found a motivational video just have to share. The basic line is in is "Dear Hard Work...." and goes on to describe hard hard work is and the benefits that one receives from it. It has me pumped. I have a saying that anything easy isn't worth doing and I tend to gravitate to things that are hard - I enjoy a challenge, especially on the bike. Check this one. Play it over and over again if you happen to be having a bad training day. Thanks to FITS Toronto for sharing this video on their website.<br /><br />
