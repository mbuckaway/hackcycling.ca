---title: Fixie Month: Power in the Pedalsvisible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  With Track Provincials coming up at the end of the month, I decided to force myself to like riding a fixed gear bike. While riding a fixie on the track is relatively easy, it's not so on the road - at least for me. There are things called "hills" to deal with. <span style="text-align: left;">Bike Couriers ride these daily and are far better at it than me. With the Fixed gear bike, u</span>nlike a regular bike with gears, there is only one gear - in this case, 46x16 or 78 gear inches. That means, I'm spinning at about 90RPM at 32km/h.

For the most part, I'm climbing out of the saddle on this machine in order to use my body weight to turn the pedals around. It saves the knees.

  Cornering has new meaning as well. Most roadies stop pedalling through corners unless they are racing. On a fixed gear bike, stopping pedalling is not an option. Stopping pedalling usually means one gets a very violent reminder that you can't. When I first got this machine, a few times I've almost been thrown from it.

  So, this month in order to build strength and skill riding a fixed gear, I'm commited to riding my Urbane Cyclist special (and the fenders make it great for the rain). I hope that improves bike handling on the track where one need only ride in straight lines.
