It's been a dismal year for riding; however, since I resolved to commute to work this year, and I have done so about 4days/week, I've taking to stop caring about the weather. When I started commuting, it was -5C out and I've riden the cross bike to the office in the snow. As for rain, consider, bike races run rain or shine, the our club's century ride last year was rode in a downpour, etc. so it's good training to get out in ride and practice staying warm while wet.<br /> <br /> A few tips for riding in the rain:<br /></span>

  * <span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">&nbsp;Make sure your tires have some kind of thread on them. Conti GP4000's come in a few colours.<br /></span>
  * <span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">&nbsp;Make sure your tires are running soft (80-90psi) for better grip</span>
  * <span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">&nbsp;If you ride with carbon wheels, expect stopping distances to be greater</span>
  * <span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">&nbsp;Ride with a waterproof rain jacket - that is on of the heavy ones that make you sweat. The light ones aren't waterproof and once you get cold, your done.</span>
  *  <span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">If it's 10-15C, overdress. You should be sweating on your first climb. After a hour, you won't be sweating anymore. Use leg warmers instead knee warmers until it's 20C out.</span>
  *  <span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">If it's foggy, use front and back lights on your bike - drivers get stupid in bad weather.</span>
  * <span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">Don't be afraid to take your lane on a decent. Your are not stopping in the wet at 60km/h. You are going down. Keep that in mind. Drivers don't seem to realize how dangerous bikes can be at speed and have no problem buzzing by.<br /></span>

<span>So, ride! Forget about the weather.</span>
