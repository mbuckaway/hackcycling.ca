---title: France: Overviewvisible: true---<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Cycling can be an excellent way to the country side of other country at the same time improving your fitness. France is home to the best know cycling race: The Tour de France. Raced over three weeks and over 3000km, riders compete for the yellow jersey and a chance to stand on the podium in Paris. Are you interested in cycling some of the best hills and mountains of southern France and climbing some mountain passes in the Pyrenees mountains? The same mountains climbed by some of the best riders on the Tour? Most cycling tours range in cost from $2000-$4000 per week because they put you up in a 3-5 star hotel, provide all meals for you, offer supported ride, etc. Hackcycling is once again putting together a trip for those on a budget. The cost will be between $900-$1100 for two weeks, cycling in the area of Limoux, see the start of Stage 16 in Carcasonne, and optionally, see the final stage in Paris. Sound interesting?

  The difference is we are staying in rented houses and meals are either cooked in the kitchen of the houses by yourself and other guests or you eat at any of the local cafes and restaurants. The cost of the trip is thus far more under your control. The trip is more suited to those who put cycling ahead of being pampered.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We will fly into Toulouse on Saturday, July 12, 2014 and be driven to Limoux or Bouriege. You will stay in houses with the our guest in private rooms where you will share bathrooms and kitchens. The house in Limoux is in the center of town and close to the cafes and restaurants.&nbsp;Clara Hughes and some other notable athletes have stayed in this houses and trained there.&nbsp;The house in Bouriege is 12km away from Limoux but has a heated pool and plenty of outdoor space. We will cycling in and around Limoux, including cycling to the Moirpoix on Monday to partake in the weekly market, cycling to the beach on the&nbsp;mediterranean sea, and spend the afternoon working on your tan, climb last years tour stage and see "shutup legs" written on the road at the top of the mountain pass, amougst other rides. For those that want to get in some extra more spirited riding, race the Buck Loop and see if you can do it under a hour, climbing, and descending and all.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Don't speak French? Don't worry. Limoux is well suited to tourists and so long as you can say "Boujour!" "Une cafe", and point, the locals are happy to accomodate you.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Hackcycling is returning to Limoux after taking a group in July 2012. Please review the details of the trip on this website, and contact me if you have any questions.

  WeThe plan for the trip to Limoux, France for Saturday, July 12, 2012 to Saturday, July 26, 2012. The tour starts in Carcasonne on Sunday, July 20. We will stay in a rented house in Limoux, France or Bouriege, France. The house in Limoux has: six separate bedrooms with single bed in each, two washrooms with showers, and a large eat in kitchen and one bedroom with a double bed. Click on the link about to see photos of the house. This house is in the center of town and everything we need is in walking distance. The town is well suited to tourists and if your french is bad, you need only point and they understand. Clara Hughes and some other notable athletes have stayed in these houses and trained there. I stayed there in July 2011 and July 2012. The house in Bourege is huge, and has double beds in most rooms. All except one room are private.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first house address is 21 rue des Oules, 11300 Limoux, France. The town square is some 300m the other way. The second house is across the river and it's address is&nbsp;46 rue Blanqu√©rie, 11300 Limoux, France. This house is on Google Steetview. The house in Bouriege isn't on Google, but see the link to their website below.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The plan is to make food ourselves in the house and everyone will share the costs. However, there are lots of restaurants in the area. Pastries and bread are ALWAY fresh from the many bakeries. Burgers and fries are available in the town square if just can't do French food. A small portion of the funds you pay will also keep the kitchen stocked with the basis of milk, juice, cereal, fruit, etc..You get to buy your own wine, beer, steaks, etc..
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Flights are best taken via Air France. The flights are from Toronto to Paris, and then Paris to Toulouse. From Toulose I will provide transport for us and our bikes. A service will pick us up from the airport and bring us and our bikes to the house. The same will happen for the return. I will also be looking at the cost of shipping bikes from Toronto to Limoux. If we do that, we will take the TGV train from Carcasonne to Paris. The train takes about as long as does getting to the airport, checking in, and getting to central Paris. The train station is in the main area of Paris.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Limoux is about 45km from the mountains. Limoux itself is on a river in a valley.&nbsp;<strong>This means everything out of the town is a climb</strong>. There are hills varying from 1% to 18%. There are many good cycling routes, and almost all including some kind of hill. YOU MUST LIKE CLIMBING!!!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Let me say that again:&nbsp;<strong><em>YOU MUST LIKE CLIMBING!!!</em></strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The trip is suitable for those who have experience with group rides, have done the Centurion, can average at least 28-30km/h avg on the flats, and can ride 40-80km between water stops.&nbsp; You should be capable of riding a 100mile century ride without a support vehicle (we stop at cafes for water/coffee). There will only be two supported rides.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The plan is to ride in the morning, and watch the Tour de France in the afternoon. Carcasonne is hosting the start of Stage 16. We will ride out to meet the "guys" on the tour route because getting into the start city is almost impossible on the day of unless you go there the night before.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What we do while there after riding will be up to the group. If you want to sit around the pubs and drink , all the power to you. If you want to go ride an additional 100km/day, sure...you can do that to. If you want to do a tour of the 30 wineries in the area, great. I am sure someone will join you. However, please come with the intention of spending most of your time riding with group in the morning. &nbsp;I will provide leadership on the rides and TCX files for your Garmin. There is lots of time to go explore on your own. If you intend to be anti-social, please rent a hotel room in town.
