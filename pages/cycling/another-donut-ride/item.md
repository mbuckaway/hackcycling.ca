---title: Video of Donut Ride...visible: true---Did the Donut Ride again on Saturday. I made it to the hill at Teston Rd, I made it up the hill with the group, but after 2 mins of running above red line, I couldn't hold the pace. Once I fell of the back of the group, the strong northerly wind catch me and I could not catch back up. You'll see my fall back of the camera in the video below after Teston Rd. However, I did what I could and got a bit faster after recovery. I kept the group in sight and managed to catch them along 15th Concession when they got trapped at a light. While it was a hard ride up there, the pace on the way back was higher. Jim, Jay, and I managed to run a pace of 2min per km (30km/h average). I was burnt out by the time I pulled off from Jim on Birchmount and headed home.
