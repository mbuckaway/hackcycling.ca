---title: Nith River Road Racevisible: true---<span id="aa43db4b-62f8-4cd5-ba99-38cc8bcb4e98">I did the Nith River Road Race on Sunday with the idea I was going to get out from of the pack, cross the finish line on the first lap, and get a photo taken. Other than that, I figured I was not going to win a bunch sprint, so why not have some fun. I finished the race with the pack in 23rd place. Some 55+ riders were present.<br /> <br /> The original idea was for two other team members to go with me and have the others block the pack, but I fell off the front of the pack on a corner on the first lap (yes, fell off the front - it happened without trying) unfortunately by myself. But, I just keep going. I was 100m in front of the pack before I realized the pack was not behind me. I spent some 8km out from of the pack and managed to pull across the finishing straight with the pack far behind me. A few team members did manage to get out front and block, which is why I believe I managed to get so far ahead and stay out front so long.<br /> <br />Here is the photo I wanted to get taken:</span>

I will say, anyone interested in racing should be adding TT's as training. It helped me. Racing is about having some fun and going home with rider and bike entacted. I did that Sunday.<br /></span>
