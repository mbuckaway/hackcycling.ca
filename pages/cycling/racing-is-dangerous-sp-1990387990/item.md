---title: Racing is dangerousvisible: true---Next week marks the three year anniversary of my crash at the Midweek Crit. I broke my leg (femur) in two places. I didn't crack the bone...I broke it. The strongest bone in my body, and I smashed it in two places. The photo of the xray is on a old article on the website somewhere. Of course, that kind of breakage happens with you fly over the handlebars at 40km/h. I will never forget it. That crash is on my mine when I race. It's on my mind when I land, as I have done twice this year, on the plate that still is holding my leg together.

This past Sunday I did the Kitchener/Waterloo Classic road race. This year, they changed the course slightly to make it longer and had a long straight section of road added with a 180 degree turn around at the end. They put 3ft high construction cones down the middle of the road and told everyone that the Yellow line rule applies there.

First, the 180 turn around, to me, is a stupid idea. While there weren't any crashes there, the cones caused lots of concern. I know I almost ran into them several times as I was pushed to the Yellow line. In the M1 category, there was a serious crash as someone bounced off of one of the cones. One of those people was our Vitess Teammate Gio who crashed in the first lap, damaged his hand, but kept going for another 10 laps before he dropped out. In the M1 race, riders were ignoring the Yellow line rule which no doubt contributed to the crash. Of course, one has to wonder why they cones were even required. Anyone crossing the line would have just be DQ'ed.

The point is explained by Michael Barry in a recent blog post. Both the organizers and the riders need to take responsibility for their actions. The organizers at the K/W Classic should have just added laps to make the race longers - that 10% grade in the middle of the course and the descents were technical enough without adding road hazzards in pilons to the race course. Riders also should stop challenging the Yellow line. I guess some riders forget that, unlike Michael Barry, we have to get up and go to work the next day to earn our paycheck and that we do not ride out bikes for a living.

Ted King of Liquigas also makes some good points on the hazzards of bad course design. He crashed out the recent Philly race when he hit a unmarked sewer grate that send him to the hospital with a broken collarbone. I suppose we are lucky that the OCA does go around the course and mark holes and hazzards with white/orange paint. I saw holes marked on the K/W Classic course. I am sure Ted would have liked that kind of warning in front of the sewer grate in his race.

Of course, at the first night at the Midweek Learn to Race course I did three years ago, we were told: "You will crash. Get over it.". The first crash this year cost me over $3000 for a bike replacement. I'm still trying to get over it. That said, I'm still racing and I never forget that it's for fun. It would be nice to podium, but if it come to risking a crash and hospital time over finishing at the back of the pack, I will finish at the back of the pack.
