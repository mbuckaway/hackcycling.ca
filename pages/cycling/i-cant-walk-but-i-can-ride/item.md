---title: I can't walk, but I can ride....visible: true---<div style="font-size: 16px;">
  <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">O</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">n June 23, I crashed during a training race. I flipped over the handlebars for some still unknown reason and hit the pavement traveling at 40km/h. I spent 2.5 weeks in the hospital and so far, a total of 10 weeks off the bike. I'm just getting back on the bike now. Last week, I was given the go-ahead by the surgeon to return to my workout routine. I can not walk perfectly without crutches, but I am getting there.</span></span>

 <span style="font-size: 10pt;">I've been on the trainer for a week now and I have managed to produce a fair amount of sweat in the 30 min rides I've done. Yesterday after my son returned from school, I dragged him out on his bike. He helped get mine out of the basement. I selected him because he's slow and can't ride far....the idea being to keep me from doing anything crazy. I was quite afraid of falling off with good reason. Armed with someone to pick me up if I fall, we set out for a 8 km slow and easy ride. There is nothing like getting on a bike after 2.5 months - my balance was off. It took 15 mins to get a handle on handling the bike. But, bike I did it. At some point, I lost my son as he fell behind and I had to stop to wait for him. What I find amazing is how much strength is gained from short workouts like the above. I'm walking around the house today largely without crutches. I'm still hobelling around, but the leg it getting stronger. </span> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>

  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">So, since I can ride, today, I took it to the next step and road farther:</span>

  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">21km. I grabbed my gear, including the RoadID to bought after the crash, and set out on a slow ride. I ran into two other D'Ornellas Bike Club members up Birchmount returning from this morning's ride. I managed to stand on the pedals. I managed to get to 350W+ on a short hill (left leg doing most of the work). So, I can ride. Of course, getting off the bike I'm reminded that I still can't walk perfectly.</span>

<div style="font-size: 16px;">
  <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Ride stats were not that bad: 51:43 time, 24.9km/h average for a pace of 2.24km/min over a 21.47km course. Cadence is still too low (average 80RPM), but I'm not interested in pushing it. There is still better than when I started the season this year.</span>
