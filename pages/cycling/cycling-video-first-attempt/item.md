---title: Cycling video: First attemptvisible: true---Sunday, I did the donut ride. I took my new VHoldr Contour HD1080p video camera with me mounted on the helmet. As it turns out, I should have tested the setup beforehard, because I only ended up filming the road in front of me. The camera was too far forward on the helmet and I have a tendancy to look down. So, I didn't capture anything much. However, I made the video from the clips that did turn out - given the ride was rather slow, the video shows the group mostly at stop lights, etc...and a sequence inside Grandma's Oven.

Next time, I should have the thing mounted on the handlebars:
