---title: When Aero is aero?visible: true---I am in the market for a TT bike. I would like to get the best aero position I can for individual time trials as well as long training rides on my own. The bent over position seems to be where I would like to end up on my road bike during long hard intervals. While I could put aerobars on my road bike, the idea of having to put them on and take them off again is a detractor and I have to wonder if there would be as good as a TT bike anyways? Then, there is a the suit. Should I ride in my normal club gear or get a skin suit? TT Aero helmet or road helmet? There is a lot of information from manufactures and from the scientific community on what constitutes the best aero position.

Allen Lim of Team Radioshack recent conducted some tests with Lance Armstrong in Hawaii where Lance wore streamer over his body. The test showed something interesting: a TT helmet saves the rider power IF the ride keeps their head straight. If the ride moves their head sideways, it creates drag. So, while a TT helmet may save 10W, unless you are a good TT ride and look only forward, it may be a detriment to the time trail. But I digress...

A recent article on Bike Radar helps filter through some of the information. Some of the key points are:

  * <span style="line-height: 24px;">Position: Going from rops to aerobars will save you ~30W at 40km/h</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 24px;">Bike: A TT bike will save you ~20W over a road bike with clipon aerobars at 40km/h</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 24px;">Helmet: A TT helmet will save you ~10W over a road helmet at 40km/h</span>
