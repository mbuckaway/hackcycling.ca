---title: Track Racers get paid...visible: true---I just remembered something that I discovered on Saturday. Like Cross races in Europe, Track racers at the Forest City Velodrome get a stripend from the ticket sales from the spectators.

Forect City holds races every Saturday evening. The spectators pay a fee to watch the races. From the proceeds, Forest City takes a cut to support keeping the place running. The remainder goes to the racers.

While I do not know if I will ever get into racing track, it is something to think about. Perhaps, an incentive to drive that distance to work on the skills to move up the ranks.

Tonight, I am going to try and get out to London after work....and then I can ride twice per week.
