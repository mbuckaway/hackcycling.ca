---title: Chinese Carbon: The Red Knight buildvisible: true---<div>
  When&nbsp;a friend of mine approached me back June about upgrading his alloy bike - the bike I bought him off of craigslist some years ago for $600 - I suggest Chinese carbon. I got him that $600 bike back when he believe $600 was too much to pay for a bike and the time he was completely shocked that $600 didn't buy a bike with pedals. He has changed his mind a bit since then by joining two bike clubs and by taking up cycling seriously.<br /><br />Considering who I was dealing with, I went out to create a midrange bike that would last him some years to come even if &nbsp;he decided to talk up racing (or not). I set on ordering a FM015 frame and fork from Hong Fu and a 38m carbon clincher wheels. The wheelset was only available with red hubs, so I took the red cue and made other parts of the bike red. We pickup out red tires, red bar tap, and a red Acronis headset. If we could have order a red seatpost clamp, we would have done so, but we settled for a black Miche seatpost clamp. The bike came with one, but I decided to replace it. The Miche clamp is just a better product and the Acronis headset makes for much easier adjustment of the headset.<br />

  <br />Thus, the build was as follows:<br />- Hong Fu FM015 and fork $405US<br />- Hong Fu Carbon Clincher 38mm wheels with Chosen Red Hubs ($450US) (rim tape was extra from the LBS)<br />- Shimano Ultegra 6700 drivetrain with 11-28 cassette, 53/39 172.5 standard crankset ($1300 from the LBS)<br />- Acronis headset in red ($60US)<br />- Miche seatpost clamp ($15US)<br />- Specialized Seat ($130 from the LBS)<br />- Red Fizik bar tape ($25)<br />- Garmin cadence sensor ($40 from gpscentral.com)<br />- Micheline Pro 3 tires with red sidewalls ($80ea from the LBS)<br />- Hong Fu Carbon bars ($30US)<br />- Hong Fu carbon seat post ($38US)<br />- Hong Fu carbon stem ($20US)<br />- Swisstap brake pads (which make the stopping distance really short)<br />- red Speedplay pedals ($200 from the LBS)<br /><br />The bike:<br /><img style="margin: 5px; border: 2px solid #000000;" alt="redknight" src="images/photos/bikes/redknight.jpg" width="500" height="292" /><br /><br />For the setup, because the rider is still a relatively new cyclist, I set the stem turned up and put the bars as high as the spacers would allow. This bike has the same issue as with my FM015 with the rear brake cable - the cable sticks - &nbsp;but managed to work around the problem. I suggested to the owner to give is two weeks to break in.&nbsp;<br /><br />The carbon wheels on this bike are amazing. I had to source the rim tape from the local bike shop, because Hong Fu doesn't supply it. But, the barrings are smooth and the wheels spin forever. The carbon rims are "sticky" and the Swisstop brake pads mean there is good stopping force - far more than any carbon wheelset I own. The Chosen rear hub however is noisy. I look inside it and it has some 100 indentation in the hub for the spines to engage. So, when in freewheel mode the hub made a buzzing sound compared to the normal click, click, click. It doesn't affect performance, and may actually proof better for racing, but for group rides it proofs noisy. I out some grease in the hub and just told the owner to never stop pedalling. I think if I ordered wheels for myself I might select different hubs unless I intended crit specific racing wheels.<br /><br />The owner is happy with the bike. I told him to take it in after two weeks use to get the cables adjusted and spoke tension checked. Like any new rider, he ignored my advise...and after I got back from France, I had to adjust the cables and sent him to the LBS to get the spoke tension fixed and wheels trued. Two spokes came loose. Given the price, I wasn't surprised. Nevermind, I have had spokes come lose on other custom build wheels I've owned when they are new and they have need to be tweaked after a few weeks of use.<br /><br />Thus, there is the Red Knight. My second chinese bike build.<br />&nbsp;
