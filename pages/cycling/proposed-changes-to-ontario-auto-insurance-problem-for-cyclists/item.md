---title: Proposed Changes to Ontario Auto Insurance problem for cyclistsvisible: true---If you happen to be one of the "few" people that do not own a car and you ride, you are at the mercy of any offending driver's insurance benefits should you be involved in a crash with a car.

The proposed changes to auto insurance in Ontario are to give the insurance buyer more choice, but may cause issues with others that do not have such a choice. With the reduction in benefits, those without a auto insurance policy could be out of luck.

Personally, this is one of the reason I would like to see insurance companies offer cycling insurance. With cyclists rides costing as much as a small car, damaged to the bicycle never mind the rider need to be covered. This would give those without auto insurance the coverage they need.
