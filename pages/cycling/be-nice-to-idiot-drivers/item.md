We've experienced stupid drivers while cycling. I've seen it happen on our group rides where some idiot behind the wheel of a 2000 point mound of steel decides the want to educate us cyclists; however, our response should be to not response.

Bob Mionske of <a href="http://bicycling.com" target="_blank" title="Bicycling Magazine">Bicycing Magazine</a> discusses the recent events where, in California, a former emergency room doctor was charged with stopping sharp in front of two cyclists and causing them to crash into the back of his car. The motorist had the intent to "teach them a lesson". For his troubles, he is now facing 5-10 years in prison. However, Bob points out that this person had done this type of thing at least twice before and because the Prosecution (Crown Lawyer in Canada) was able to establish a pattern of behaviour, this motorist is actually facing sentencing. Had a pattern not been established, it is likely that the angry response from the cyclists to this driver would have warrented the charges be dropped.

 

It is a scary throught. You are riding your bike and minding your own business when a idiot behind the wheel of a 2000lbs pile of metal decides to "educate" you on the rules of the road. It's happened to me. I've been run off the road by idiot because I was riding on the road. It's happened on group ride when drivers honk their horn at us or worse, pull up beside the lead rider to let them know they throughts on where cyclists belong. However, Bob suggests to let it go. Wave them on. Suggest they have a nice day, but never swear at them or flip them "the bird". In the case of a crash, it is highly likely your actions (or reaction) will be taken into consideration when deciding if the driver should be charged or not.

Read the <a href="http://bicycling.com/blogs/roadrights/2009/11/05/justice-served/" target="_blank" title="Road Rights">article</a> and be nice to the idiots on the road. Remember, in the fight with a car, the cyclist will ALWAYS lose.
