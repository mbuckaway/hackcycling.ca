  Motivation is...
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Suiting up after work after watching the temperature drop all afternoon from -6C to -10C with windchills below -14C.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Treking down to the University of Toronto <strong>by bike</strong> to be tested on a 5 min critical power test, a test designed to leave you completely wiped.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Suiting back up again and heading out, in the dark, into the night, by bike into the cold for the ride home.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Realizing that it's gotting colder as I ride.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Facing a 20-30km wind that is in my face the entire ride.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Riding my fixed gear bike and suffering with a cadence that never makes it over 80RPM because of the wind and a speed that never makes it to 28km/h.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Realizing as you cross the Bloor Viaduct, that there is still 30-40 mins to ride.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Riding up Leslie St. in full out TT mode and struggling to get up the hills that normally are easy.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Hitting Leslie and Sheppard and realizing that you are about to bonk as you stare at the last remaining "hill" on the ride.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Yet, still, somehow, out of nowhere managing to find the energy to get out of the saddle and give every last remaining bit left to sprint up the "climb" because, dammit, the only thing you wanted more than the pain in the legs is to get inside, in the warm house, and dammit OUT OF THE COLD.

  The ride home tonight felt like I was climbing Mt. Ventoux given the head wind, the hills, and the fixed gear bike that caused a really low cadence. While the testing at UofT hurt, it didn't kill me, but the ride home did. If I had a power meter on, I swear it felt like I would have averaged 300W because I was so motivated to get home as fast as I could. I don't think I've struggled so much getting up Leslie as I did tonight.

  Egads, my legs are completely fried....
