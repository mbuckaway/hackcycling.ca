---title: Riding rollersvisible: true---Rollers. I bought a cheap set about 2 years ago or more before I got serious into cycling. My cycling buddy at the time suggested that they are better for you than riding a trainer because they work the same mucsles as riding because you are actually riding the bike. Balance and bike handling are improved as well.

I can remember my first attempts at the rollers. I set the bike up in between a door frame. Made sure my elbows could hit the door frame if I deviated too far. I wore my helmet for safty. I managed to ride for some time...but still mantained a death grip on the bars and couldn't look away from the front wheel without crashing. As I thought I got better, I moved the rollers to another room and only have something to hang onto. I can recall attempting to reach for the water bottle the first time and recalling after lying on the floor what a mistake that was. My family only came the first time I crashed to see if I was ok....after that, it didn't matter if I was hurt or not. "Oh, he's down again" was the kind of attitude I received.

Fast forward to now. I spend some 2-8 hours per week riding the <a target="_blank" title="Forest City Velodrome" href="http://www.forestcityvelodrome.ca">Forest City Velodrome</a> in London, ON. Everyone there rides rollers as part of their warmup. So, when I got my track bike in December, I put it on the rollers and rode it. I found it was easier than previous attempts. The experience of the track made my handling skills much better. This month I have not used the trainer at all. I ride the rollers for short spins (<1hr) and warm ups for weights. I find that I can easily spin on them and not get bored. I also practice some of my track skills because I find it similar to riding the track. I can now ride rollers without any hands on the bars, one hand on the bars, one foot in the peddles, etc.. On the cheap set of rollers, I can almost stand up to stretch.

So, this morning, I invested in a new set. <a target="_blank" title="TruTrainer Rollers" href="http://www.trutrainer.com">TruTrainer</a> makes a set of rollers that are weighted to simular road riding. Apparently, a road bike can spin down over 30 secs and one can get out of the saddle and sprint. To me, this would be useful, because intervals on rollers would improve my handling skills and keep me entertained, and riding a trainer will not.
