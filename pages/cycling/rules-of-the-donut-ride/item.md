---title: Rules of the Donut Ridevisible: true---On Sunday, I did the Donut Ride. The Donut Ride is an instituion of sorts here in Toronto. It has been running since the early 1970's when it was a club ride that started at the donut shop that once existed at Eglington and Laird. Even after the club that started the ride stopped supporting it, it continued and continues to this day. Riders start at 9AM at Eglington and Laird and ride up Bayview Ave. collecting riders we they go. When the ride hits Keele and Langstaff in Vaugh, the ride usually has some 100 riders. It runs every Saturday, Sunday, and Holiday year round.

On the ride this past Sunday, someone was screaming about the breach of the yellow line when we were racing down Leslie St. While breaching the yellow line on the road is not a good idea, Donut Riders will do it. This incident caused me to think of the rules of the donut ride. Generally speaking, rules there are but very few. I am no expert. Some of the donut riders have been doing the ride for years and I've only been doing it for months, but I've come to realize a few things in that short time. I will explain the few rules of the ride and look for comments.

Rules:

1) You are on your own.

If you flat or get dropped, too bad. If you get stuck at a light because you stopped, too bad. No one will wait. Occasionally, a rider will offer assistance, but for the most part everyone is too wrapped up in the current sprint to worry about someone else. You must come prepared to repair your own bike and be prepared to finish the ride without the pack if you get dropped for any reason. If you get dropped on Keele St, you have to about 11AM to make it to Grandma's Oven to catch the pack riding home. Simularly, anyone riding the Donut Ride must realize it is far more dangerous than a group ride. There will be crashes. You could be part of a crash. Be smart: carry ID and a cell phone. Be prepared to ride on your own.

2) It is a race.

Most clubs run group rides with the mantra it is not a race. The donut ride is all about ego and who can be the fastest. The past Sunday's ride reached speeds of 70km/h and averaged 35.1km/h for the 100km of the part of the ride I rode. There were fast sprints up Keele St. and the ride down Leslie St. followed with attack after attack. The attacks continued into the city and didn't really stop until Don Mills and Finch. Thing get "worse" if you go with the Jane St gang or follow the group that goes to Vandoof for a longer ride. Because it is a race, racing tactics apply. It is all about attacking, recovering, and attacking again. Also, because it is a race, it's not a training ride. One can't build endurance by doing the donut ride.

3) Hold your line and ride straight.

Hold your line on the turns and ride straight when in the pack. This rule is about the only rule the pack will strongly enforce. I must admit to being "told" numerous times for breaching the "ride straight" rule. A lot of the riders also race regularly and do not like riders that cut them off - well, no one like being cut off - and have no problem screaming "RIDE STRAIGHT" or tugging on a jersey to inform the offender. While there is a notion of never to half wheel anyone, it happens. Riding straight prevents someone who is half wheeling from taking out the pack if you screw up.

4) Don't stop unless the pack does.

Ontario traffic laws require we stop at stop signs and traffic lights. However, with 100 riders in tow, for the most part, these laws are ignored - be that a good or bad thing. Most other traffic on the road will give the pack way at stop signs and lights because of the size of the pack. 100 riders suddenly hovering around a car at a light or on the road usually causes the driver to slow down or stop. That said, the donut ride will stop at a light if there is enough time to do so. The lead riders will usually stop and indicate such to other riders when approaching a major intersection. However, minor intersections and four way stops are generally ignored. Thus, never stop for a light or stop sign mid-pack unless the rest of the pack does; otherwise, you could take out numerous riders in a crash. You will get yelled at if you stop mid pack.

5) Use common sense.

This rule is more about good manners than a requirement.&nbsp;

- Scream CAR UP, CAR BACK, CAR LEFT or CAR RIGHT when appropriate. . With a 100 riders, usually someone will say something.

- Indicate you are stopping, turning, etc. Basically, let the pack know what you are doing.

- Point out large holes and problems on the road. Donut rides usually point out the really dangerous stuff. If someone is point out all the holes, they came from some sane club ride and are new to the donut ride. Make sure you are no where near them during a sprint.

- Don't chew anyone out for forgetting this rule....you'll get told it's the donut ride and to shut the BEEP up. Remember rule #1 and pay attention to the world around you.

7) There is no yellow line rule.

The donut ride is somewhat lawless. There is no yellow line rule. If there are enough riders in the way, some riders will go over the yellow line to get by. While this is done, it is generally a bad idea. Riders will scream "CAR UP" to let everyone know a car is coming, but anyone going over the yellow line does so at the own risk. Again, rule #1 applies here.

8) It's the Donut Ride.

There really are no other rules. If you want a nice sane group ride, go find one somewhere else. You do the Donut Ride because it's a fast and hard ride that runs year round, rain or shine, on snowy or dry roads. You ride it to challenge your abilities.
