---title: What is talent, really?visible: true---<div>
  This year I am learning, through my coach largely, that winning requires suffering. Intuitively, I do understand this fact in relation to most other things in my life. I am currently learning that it applies even more so to cycling and winning bike races. There is nothing easy about being the leader of the race. The cross race I did over the weekend prove enough that the winners are the ones that can suffer the most. I spent 44 mins in low zone 4...and I have never done that before. To win at cross, I figure I have to be able to suffer in high zone 4 and still be able to ride, get off the bike, run, and everything else in between along with improving my handling skills.<br /><br />Here is a good quote from Eddy Merck on that topic:<br /><br />"What is talent, really? Is it the fact that your heart pumps more volume than the average person's, or that your blood turns less acidic when exercising so that you recover faster? Noâ€”talent has to do with your capacity for suffering. You just learn to suffer more. In the end, maybe, there is no explaining. Why are some people so intelligent? Why is a brain surgeon so deft with his fingers? What is about his vision that makes a man a great artist?"<br /><br />-Eddy Merck
