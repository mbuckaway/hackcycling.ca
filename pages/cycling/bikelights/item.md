---title: Bike lights useful before duskvisible: true---The other day I was driving to York University for my class. While driving near the entrance of the parking lot, I happened upon a cyclist riding a mountain bike. I remember him because he was in full riding gear and had clip-less pedals. He also outfitted his bike with high powered lights on the front and the back. It was 6:12PM and it was not yet dark out and not even near dusk. In fact, had I been out riding I doubt I would have had my lights on already. However, this cyclist did have his lights on and because he did I saw him from 500m away when approaching him and 500m away when I passed him. All the cars had running day lights which made them stand out. The experience pointed out the importance of having proper lighting on the bike and why is it a good idea to turn them on well before dusk. Because this cyclist had his lights on, he could be seen as well as any of the cars on the road. Next time I'm out riding a hour before dusk, my lights will be on.
