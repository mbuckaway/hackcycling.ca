---title: Winter Gear Trial #2. Warm and toastyvisible: true---Today, while the office was eating lunch out and having the holiday party (I was working from home), I put on my winter riding gear and went for a 10km jaunt outside. The weather was reported as being -8C and sunny. In fact, the sun was rather warm. There was a light breeze from the west. The idea was to try out the winter gear in conditions that I would be experiencing on the weekend on the Donut Ride. The plan is to ride the Donut Ride on Sunday from some other insan-i-acts from the club. Here is the result:

![Winter Bike #2][8]

The outfit was not entirely complete. Missing are the bike shorts underneath, bike jersey (for extra pockets) and the shoe covers; however, but given the short ride, I didn't care. The end result is after about 15 mins, I warmed up to the point where I didn't notice the cold anymore. It's always interesting to feel the wind turn from an icy chill to a warm breeze once one gets sufficiently warmed up; however, until this point, it's rather cold on the face and the cold wind cools the jacket off enough to be felt on the skin. But again, once warmed up, I didn't care. In fact, I'll have to adjust the riding glasses because there start to get fogged up when I ride to slowly.

Thus, it may be -8C out, but by the time I got home, I didn't care.

The outfit:

  * <span style="line-height: 24px; font-size: small;">Windproof jacket (Biemme)</span>
  * <span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">D'Ornella's Vest (under the Jacket) by Louis Garneau</span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Wind front baselayer by Craft (Costco has a cheaper version without the windfront)</span></span></span>
  * <span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Short sleeve technical t-shirt (from Costco)</span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Claw type gloves by Pearle Izumi</span></span></span>
  * <span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Heavy tights (no bib) - had track pants on under these, but normally wear bike shorts with bib</span></span>
  * <span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Specialized Neoprene wind/waterproof socks worn on the feet (Normally, I would add the Pearle Izumi neoprene shoecovers to keep the wind off the feet)</span></span>
  * <span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">non-name technical bellacara and Sugio winter sweat cap under the Lazer helmet</span></span>
  * <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 24px;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Rudy Project prescription shades (stuck on the helmet for the photo)</span></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt;">While riding on the trainer in winter allows for some good interval sessions, there is nothing like a sprint on a ride in the great outdoors to keep it fun.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><br /></span> <span style="font-size: 10pt;"></span>
