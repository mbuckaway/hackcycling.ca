---title: Collingwood Rides to startvisible: true---Last season, I started the Collingwood-rides mailing list. I posted a message today to remind everyone that it still exists. I excited to report there seems to be some interest in getting more regular groups riding up there. A fair number of people living in Collingwood, in the Pretty River area, or close to Creemore.

If you are looking to get in some hill training on some of the longest hills in Ontario, then come join our mailing list. Click on <a target="_blank" title="Collingwood Rides" href="http://lists.hackcycling.ca/mailman/listinfo/collingwood-rides">COLLINGWOOD-RIDES</a>

Members of the group are currently looking to ride this weekend. I may start a ride on April 9 because I need time on some dirt roads for Tour of Bronte prep.

Check out the list.
