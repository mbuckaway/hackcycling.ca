---title: D'Ornellas Fitness Factory Southvisible: true---The D'Ornellas Fitness Factory has moved south for the winter! Well, not really, but Eon D'Ornellas (owner of the D'Ornellas Bike Shop) invites D'Ornellas Racing Team (bike club) members to his Florida home to ride.

For the week of New Years Day, we (the family) drove to Florida to spend New Years Eve at my cousin's wedding. Our trip started in the Orlando area where we visited Universal Studios Theme park and stopped in at the residence of Eon D'Ornellas for a bike ride. Well, I rode and the family went shopping. I borrowed two video cameras for the trip - one hand held HD cam and a GO Pro (thanks Jay M.!) which I attached to my bike. The video below the 15 min version of the complete video (which I will play at the Fitness Factory at some point). The video below shows the ride on Wednesday, December 30. The temperature was 20C (at least) and the skies were clear.&nbsp;

Eon and I also rode again on the Friday when I stayed with him for the night. The camera didn't work for that ride. I think the most memorable time with Eon was sitting in his garage after the Wednesday ride, drinking beer (which apparently is a recovery drink), and talking about how guys shave their legs. Chris says _Neet for Men_ is the way to go. I bought it, but still have yet to try it. I also learned from Eon that Guinness is only 80 calories.

It was a fine week and a good set of rides.
