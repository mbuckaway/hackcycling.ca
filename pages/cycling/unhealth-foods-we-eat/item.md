---title: Unhealth Foods We Eatvisible: true---The Lance Armstrong Fountion has recently posted an article entitled "<a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/70149-top-worst-foods-kids-eat/?utm_source=jannewsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=100126" target="_blank">The Worst Foods to Feed to Your Kids</a>". It discusses some of the most common "kid foods" parents throw at their kids. Funny, it includes most things my mother never fed us as kids, but parents today have gotten lazy.

Here is the list of foods to avoid:

  1. Hotdogs (high in fat and salt)
  2. Soda or Pop (liquid candy)
  3. Sticky candy (candy is a treat, not a meal)
  4. Donuts (the average Tim Horton's donut is 300cals or more - their muffins are worse)
  5. Prepackaged lunch kits (high in fat and salt)
  6. Sugary breakfast cereals (watch, even the "healthy" ones are high in sugar or worse, high-fructore corn syrup - Life cereal comes to mind)
  7. Microwavable prepackaged dinners (engineered to taste good and make you fat)
  8. (Fake) Juice drinks (Not 100% juice? Then, most likely 75% sugar)
  9. French fries (fat, fat, fat)
 10. Toaster Pastries (sugar and fat - why not just make toast?)

The key: avoid processed foods. Period. If you didn't make it yourself, chances are it's not something that you should  be eating. While the LAF article suggests that kids are fed these things, how many adults eat a donut for breakfast or throw a microwave dinner in the nuker at work?
