---title: Off Season? What Off Season?visible: true---<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Dr. Jim Taylor is a leading high performance Sports Psychologist. He was recently interviewed by Achieve Training and Coaching for their blog. I have been hearly alot lately how it is the "off-season". Somehow, this means, the training regiment is stopped, and just riding around begins or worse: nothing. We all need a short break, but if we wait too long, fitness drops. This has been my experience the last two winters. I stopped any real training in the fall when I went to York University to take courses, and by the time January came along, I was back to build again...only to discover a general lack of race readiness until about June in the summer - you know, when race season is about over.

  From the arcticle, I love this statement:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  "ED: As a sports psychologist, how do you approach the off-season with your athletes?
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  JT: I am a firm believer that next season starts now. After a few weeks recovery its time to get back in the game. But itâ€™s more than just going out a riding a whole bunch."

  This is the same mentality put forth by Ed Veal and the <a href="http://www.realdealracing.ca" title="Real Deal Racing" target="_blank">Real Deal Performance</a> team.&nbsp;There isn't really an off-season. I took a 2.5 week recovery break in September, but I intend to be ready to race for Track Nationals in January and for racing on the road in Florida in March and Georgia in April. Too long of a break, and your fitness will drop.
