---title: Crash in the RAAM: Do it again.visible: true---I know what it is like to crash a bike. I spent eight months recovering and getting my fitness back after crashing and breaking my leg in June 2009. However, I got back on the bike and look forward to completing the Blue Mountain Gran Fondo in September.

So, when I read this article about Sir Steve Redgrave who crashed 200 miles from the finish of the RAAM, I know something about what he was feeling. Of course, I wasn't racing across America, but I know how he feels. I can also echo his feeling of wanting to do it again. The challenge is something of a great draw.

Read through the article. It's a good read:
