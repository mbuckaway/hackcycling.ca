---title: Florida: The Planvisible: true---<p class="p1">
  March Break in 2016 is March 14-18. Training camp will be held from from March 12 to 19 for one week. The training camp is suitable for those interested in racing and for those interested in just riding in the warm weather. The focus will be riding and rides will be no-drop. For those interested in racing, we will do the Windemere ride and take in the Florida Sunshine week races in Tampa on March 19 and 20. Info on racing is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://floridacycling.com/index.php/news">http://floridacycling.com/index.php/news</a>

  We have a house located just south of the Clermont area around the junction of Hwy 27 and Hwy 192 and 20 min from Disney. Space is limited, so we suggest booking ASAP.&nbsp;This is a four bedroom house with rooms with two single beds, rooms with queen and king size beds along with pull out coaches, multiple bathrooms, large kitchens, and a pool to cool off in.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  The fridge in the house will be stocked with milk, juice, eggs, etc. and items generally needed for breakfast. You will be responsible for lunch and dinner either preparing your own food in the kitchen, sharing expenses with other participants, or going out to eat. If everyone agrees, I will looking to catering the last meal each week of the trip to make it easier on everyone.

  The cost of the training camp will be $375/wk for accommodation and guide lead training rides for shared accomodation in &nbsp;a house. We can make arrangements so you can bring your spouse if you want. You can send them off to explore Disney in the morning with you ride, and get together with them in the afternoon. I should mention most other training camps charge around $700+ for one week, so this camp is a deal. That said, if we can reduce the cost of the trip or throw in free meals, we will. The cost includes breakfast food. We will stock the fridge with eggs, milk, juice, and put things like cereal and oatmeal in the cupboards. Lunches and dinner are on you.

  Rides will be available in advance with TCX files for your garmin. Rides will be lead by me. I've been to the Clermont area a few times and have good idea of the cycling routes.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Getting there: I suggest driving. It will probably be cheaper than flying especially with a bike. However, we can coordinate pickup from one of the two Orlando Airports if required at an additional expense. Bookings are Sat to Sat. You can arrive anytime and leave anytime within your allowed week.

  I have experience building bikes and can assist anyone flying in with the build and tear down of their bike. Eon D'Ornellas lives in the area, and we may be able to enlist his assistance if required.

<p class="p1">
  Fitness level: You will be expected to ride at 28km/h in a pack. Stronger riders will spend more time on the front. If you can do your regular club ride, you will fit in with us. Faster riders will be encouraged to do the Windmere ride and race on the weekend.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Racing: There is a circuit race in the park not far from the house some participated in last year. If the race is running, we will do it again. There is also the local Windmere Ride which runs Wed's and Sat's. If you know what the Toronto Donut Ride is, then, this ride is harder and faster depending on who shows up. Two Ontario U19 riders last year blew the pack apart. If you are into racing,&nbsp;then you need to do this ride.
