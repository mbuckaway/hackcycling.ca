  <strong>Purpose of Training Camp</strong>
</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  Going to training camp in the spring? Are you going to train or to ride your bike up long climbs and drink beer? Most training camps are set in North Carolina along the Blue Ridge Mountains and consist of lots of long rides with long climbs. I ask you: how is this representative to the riding you do in Ontario? If you are just training to get ready for a summer of weekend group rides, then long 15km+ climbs nothing like the roads in Ontario. If you are racing, the longest climb on the OCUP roster is 8km in the Grey Country RR....and most of Ontario races are dead pan flat in comparison to the Carolinas. Early season training camp is about getting back on the bike after a winter of training indoors and remember how to ride your bike on the road. Hills? Hills have little to do with it.

  <strong>Why Florida?</strong>
</p>

<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">
  After spending a week in Florida in February 2014, I found NC too cold to be enjoyable. Florida was 25C all week. No arm warmers required. The roads around Clermont, FL - just outside of Disney - resemble Ontario. Everyone thinks the only hills in Florida are highway overpasses, and this is not the case. Roads in and around Clement are either flat or rolling hills. Sugar Loaf Mountain Road is a punchie 3min climb that hits 12% and resembles the Brimley Rd climb out of the Scarborough Bluffs in Toronto. So, there are hill repeats available if you want that.

  Also, consider the weather. In February and March the Clermont area temperatures are 20-30C. You will arrive and immediately have to put on shorts. You will be riding in your cycling kit and arm warmers won't be required....even at 9am. Florida is farther south so it's just nicer weather. After a hard winter in Toronto with temps around the freezing mark, it really feels strange to be able to ride without any layers. It is a great feeling. Nevermind, on our rides, we will stop and pick oranges and tangerines from the trees.

  We will ride to Disney to take photos. Disney is 10 mins away. The attractions in Orlando are 30 mins away. If you bring your spouse, you can ride in the morning while the spouse takes in the fun. You need not compromise between riding and involving your significant other.

  For those into racing, racing in Florida starts in January. So, by March there are usually races every weekend. The local club runs a 20km TT every Tuesday at the Orlando airport. If you have ever done the Toronto Donut Ride, then you will be happy hammering it out on the Windermere Ride....which apparently, is faster than the Donut Ride. My plan is to take in at least one race while in Florida to test the racing legs and do the Orlando TT at least once. By all means, you don't have too.

  For triathletes,  Clement<span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 15.8079996109009px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 15.8079996109009px;">National Training Center has a pool and running track so you can do your entire set of workouts. There are also trails close to the house to be able to get in your run after a ride. There is the perfect area to train for that big early season race.</span>

  Four time Olympian, Eon D'Ornellas calls Clermont home during the winter months, and we will also connect with him to tap into his knowledge of the area and or training in general. Motor pacing will be available from Eon at an additional cost.
