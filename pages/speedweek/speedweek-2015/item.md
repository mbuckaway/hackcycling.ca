---title: Speedweek Training Campvisible: true---Racing in Ontario in April is great IF you like showing up to the start line in your winter cycling gear. In places like in the southern US, it's warm. The USA Crits Speedweek series is a series of criterium's that starts in Athens, GA with the Athens Twilight is a week of fast crit racing for all categories and ends a week later after racing no less than five crits in various locations around Georgia. To me, Speedweek is a good training camp to wake up your desire to race for the season in a place where your results really do not matter, but where you can test your fitness and build speed for the return to racing in Ontario. As an added benefit, the temperature on the start line rarely dips below 20C. When is the last time you raced when it was 20C+ out in April?

**The Plan**

The plan is to leave Toronto on April 23 and drive 15 hrs to Athens, GA and take up residence in a rented house. I found one that can hold 8 guys for $195US/night. This will be our basecamp for three days. April 24 we will check out the amateur race course and ride around it to get accustom to the "hill". We will then watch the grid qualifiers where some of the top pro racers compete on computrainers for a call up for the Pro race. If you are good enough to race in the Pro race, you will do the Grid qualifier. Ed Veal won the grid qualifier in 2012 by hammering out 500W for 8 mins spinning at 105RPM. April 25 we race in amatuer qualifier. I intend to race the cat4 and masters 45+ races. I want two chances to get into the ametuer final. Those placing in the top 10 qualify to race the final which runs on the downtown pro course just before the Pro's race. This will be a tough race because it pits ALL ametuer finalists against each other from CAT 1 to CAT 4 and women from all categories.

The next morning we get up early, and drive out to Roswell, GA about 1.5hrs away. Roswell is just north of Atlanta. We will race the Roswell crit. I intend to do the cat4 and masters 45+ races again. This time, I want to redeem myself and finish well. The last time I did this crit it was in the pouring rain and the 120 corner almost took me out. At the end of the day after watching the Pro race, we will head back to Athens to get a good night sleep, and then head out to the next location.

The rest of the week will be staying in hotels. Most races require a one night stay and then we move on again. Complete plans will be computed when USA Crits publishes the schedule for Speedweek. Typically, we return to Toronto the following weekend. Yes, this usually means you will miss Springbank, but after racing all week in the warm weather, do you really want to race a crit in a park in Ontario?

SHORT OPTION: For those with evil spouses, you can option for the "short option". Come down with us for the races in Athens and Roswell and return home. You can do this weekend by either driving down or flying down. You can fly into Atlanta, join us in Athens, and then fly out after the Roswell crit since Roswell is close to Atlanta.

**COSTS**

The costs of race fees is about $300US for the entire week of racing, but depends on the number of races you enter per day. Each race is about $35US. The house in Athens is $195US/night for about $600US for three days divided amongst those who attend. The rest of the week will see hotels at about $125US/night shared by two people per room. If it makes sense, we will rent a house in each city. It cost me about $1200 last time for hotels, gas, etc.. Complete costs will be calculated when USA Crits posts the schedule for the races.
