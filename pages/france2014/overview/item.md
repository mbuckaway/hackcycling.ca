  Cycling can be an excellent way to the country side of other country at the same time improving your fitness. France is home to the best know cycling race: The Tour de France. Raced over three weeks and over 3000km, riders compete for the yellow jersey and a chance to stand on the podium in Paris. Are you interested in cycling some of the best hills and mountains of southern France and climbing some mountain passes in the Pyrenees mountains? The same mountains climbed by some of the best riders on the Tour? Most cycling tours range in cost from $2000-$4000 per week because they put you up in a 3-5 star hotel, provide all meals for you, offer supported ride, etc. Hackcycling is once again putting together a trip for those on a budget. The cost will be$1499 for two weeks, cycling in the area of Limoux, see the start of a tour stage on the top of a mountain and get on TV, and optionally, see the final stage in Paris. Sound interesting?

  The difference is we are staying in rented houses and meals are either cooked in the kitchen of the houses by yourself and other guests or you eat at any of the local cafes and restaurants. The cost of the trip is thus far more under your control. The trip is more suited to those who put cycling ahead of being pampered.

  We will fly from Toronto on Friday, July 8, 2016 into Paris and connect to Toulouse on landing on Saturday, July 9, 2016. At, 3pm in Toulouse, I will meet you and we will be driven to Bouriege. You will stay in houses sharing bathrooms and kitchens by have your own private room. Your spouse can share the room with you for a small supplement fee (we don't penalize singles). The house in <span style="font-size: 12.16px; line-height: 15.808px;">Bouriege</span> is 12km from the center of town of Limoux where there are cafes and restaurants. Clara Hughes and some other notable athletes have stayed in the area and trained there. The house has a heated pool, plenty of outdoor space, several patios, and lots of common space indoors as well. You can socialize with the group or find a spot to take some time to yourself. Unlike previous years, there will be just a lot more space for everyone. We will cycling in and around Limoux and Bouriege, including cycling to the Moirpoix on Monday to partake in the weekly market, take a supposed trip to the beach on the mediterranean sea, and spend the afternoon working on your tan, climb last years tour stage and see "shutup legs" written on the road at the top of the mountain pass, amougst other rides. For those that want to get in some extra more spirited riding, race the Buck Loop and see if you can do it under a hour, climbing, and descending and all.

  Don't speak French? Don't worry. Limoux and Bouiege is well suited to tourists and so long as you can say "Boujour!" "Une cafe", and point, the locals are happy to accommodate you.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  On Sat. July 23, we leave Limoux to fly to Paris. You can optionally stay over in Paris to see the last stage of the tour. We usually check your bike into the Left Luggage area at the Paris Airport, and take a cab into the city to your hotel. If you are not staying in Paris, you will be returning to Toronto with your connecting flight. The 2016 Tour de France arrives on Sunday, July 24, 2016 in Paris with the Women of La Course racing in the late morning, and the guys doing 7 laps or more around central Paris in the afternoon. When you return to Toronto from Paris is up to you. If you are like most, you will return on Monday, July 25, but some stay around looking to take in the sights of Paris.
