<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Overview:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is a trip for anyone on a budget that doesn't have $2000-4000CND to drop on a fully supported two week trip in France.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The plan for the trip to Limoux, France for two weeks.  We will stay in a rented house in Bouriege, France with an option to stay in Limoux. The house in <span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 15.8079996109009px;">Bouriege</span> has: up to 10 separate bedrooms with double bed in each, multiple washrooms with showers, and up to three kitchens (one commercial style kitchen with a wood fired brick baking oven), a heated outdoor pool, and a huge outdoor patio with BBQ. Click on the link about to see photos of the house. This house is 12km from Limoux, and center to all the riding routes. The house is HUGE. You literally could spend the entire day in the house and not bump into the same people. There is lots of common space to make the trip enjoyable. For those that prefer to be in town, we are offering an option to stay in Limoux. The town is well suited to tourists and if your french is bad, you need only point and they understand. Clara Hughes has stayed in the area and the TIBCO Pro Women's team run their February training camp from Limoux.  The house in Bourege is huge, and has double beds in most rooms. All except one room are private.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The house in <span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 15.8079996109009px;">Bouriege</span> is located at Rue de La Poste, Bouriege, France 11300 and the house in Limoux is located at 21 rue des Oules, 11300 Limoux, France. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The plan is to make food ourselves in the house and everyone will share the costs. However, there are lots of restaurants in the area. Pastries and bread are ALWAY fresh from the many bakeries. Bread is delivered to the house in Boureige every three days and there is a cafe in town for other needs. A small portion of the funds you pay will also keep the kitchen stocked with the basis of milk, juice, cereal, fruit, etc.. You get to buy your own wine, beer, steaks, etc..
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This time around I will be working with a travel agent to get a group rate on flights with Air France. The flights are from Toronto to Paris, and then Paris to Toulouse. From Toulouse I will provide transport for us and our bikes. A service will pick us up from the airport and bring us and our bikes to the house. The same will happen for the return. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Bouiege and Limoux are about 45km from the mountains. Limoux itself is on a river in a valley. Bouiege is in the hills <strong>This means everything out of each town is a climb</strong>. There are hills varying from 1% to 18%. There are many good cycling routes, and almost all including some kind of hill. YOU MUST LIKE CLIMBING!!!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Let me say that again: <strong><em>YOU MUST LIKE CLIMBING!!!</em></strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The trip is suitable for those who have experience with group rides, have done the Centurion, can average at least 28-30km/h avg on the flats, and can ride 40-80km between water stops.  You should be capable of riding a 100mile century ride without a support vehicle (we stop at cafes for water/coffee). There will only be two supported rides.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The plan is to ride in the morning, and watch the Tour de France in the afternoon.  There will be two supported trips: one to the beach in the town of Lucat on the Mediterranian Sea and one to climb the Col de Tourmalet. These cost of these trips are included in the fee.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I will be renting a vehicle and providing shuttle service to/from Limoux from Bouiege for those that want to spend the afternoon in town. We will also do afternoon trips to the local sites.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  What we do while there after riding will be up to the group. If you want to sit around the pubs and drink , all the power to you. There is an Irish Pub in town where they speak english first, and french second. If you want to go ride an additional 100km/day, sure...you can do that to. If you want to do a tour of the 30 wineries in the area, great. I am sure someone will join you. However, please come with the intention of spending most of your time riding with group in the morning.  I will provide leadership on the rides and TCX files for your Garmin. There is lots of time to go explore on your own. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The trip can be spouse friendly IF there are more than one spouse along. I can arrange for day trips for your spouse to keep them entertained for an additional cost where they will be pampered from the morning to the evening. However, I suggest they like to ride, because this is a cycling trip. Ask me for more information.
</p>

<hr id="system-readmore" />

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <br />RIDING DETAILS:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My recommendation is for everyone to dedicate two weeks to the trip. The costs is the same for everyone if you stay less than two weeks. We will spend the two weeks riding the hills and mountains in the area. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I would expect everyone on the trip to be able to ride at least 28-30km/h or faster on the flats. While we will wait at the top of all climbs for the slower riders, you must be able to ride your bike with confidence up and down major climbs. If you ever had the thought of walking up a hill, you will be unhappy and so will the rest of the group! No one likes waiting at the top of a 5km climb for 30 mins. While we will ride to coffee shops, it will be always at a moderate pace. Faster riders will be encouraged to go off the front and meet us at the cafe. We should see an increase in fitness on our return. I also hope there will be enough strong riders that like a challenge so every hill top is another KOM experience. We will also do the 10 Hills Ride as a training ride; that is, like the Donut Ride, ride as fast as you can with the idea of riding as many of the 10 "hills" as possible; but everything else will be done as a group. Bouiege is in the middle of the 10 Hills Ride.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Everyone that has a Garmin 705/800 should buy the european maps. The rides are already mapped out and appear on ridewithgps.com. I will be ride leader, but without a garmin, you will have to make sure you never are riding on your own. While we will stick together on group rides, you may way to do some riding on your own to push the pace or join a ride in the afternoon that is harder/faster. Rides will be unsupported. There are cafes in most towns, so it is nothing to be able to ride from town to town for water/coffee. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There will be no support vehicle other than for the ride to the beach and one of the mountain rides. If there are enough fit riders, we can do the 160km two cols ride up two mountain climbs. There is a 40km descent on the back side of that ride.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I will be renting a van to shuttle people around Limoux and nearby citys. So, it will be possible to take some interested parties on tours in the afternoon, perhaps some sightseeing trips into the mountains for photos or tour a winery.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Expect rides to be between 50-180km starting at 9AM and last to 4-8 hours depending on distance, the number of mountains/hills climbed, and the speed of the slowest rider. Rides in France just take longer because of the hills. If you were used to riding 90km in three hours here in Ontario, you can expect it to take 4-5 hours there.

  ACCOMMODATION:
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  <a title="Kiwi House France" href="images/kiwihouse_france.pdf" target="_blank">LINK: PDF FILE OF THE HOUSE</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  LINK: <a href="http:/www.bouriege.com/index.html">HOUSE IS BOUIEGE</a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
   
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first house is in Bouriege and it has lots of common space, a heated pool, a three kitchens, two BBQ's, patio above the pool, and patio across the street. So, there is space to work on your tan after a ride.  If you have been to Limoux before, you will like this house much better. The beds are bigger and there is more space. There is a cafe in town literally beside the house and it is a short ride/drive into Limoux (12km). I will be renting a van so I will provide transportation to/from town or you can hop on your bike into town. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The second house is 21 rue des Oules, Limoux and has seven rooms each with a single bed, desk, lamp. One room has a double bed which will go to the first person booking into this house. There are two bathooms which we share. It has a full kitchen with two fridges.  Unfortunately, while the house in the middle of town, more than a few people in the house will have us tripping over each other. I will use this house to accomodate those wishing to stay in town, or as overflow from the house in Bouriege.
</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  All houses have a large livingroom with TV and free WIFI. The tour is always available to watch in the afternoon on TV. There is a Walmart style store at the on the edge of Limoux. Food is either bought locally and made in the kitchen, or a short walk to places in the town square for things like fine french food to American style fries. If you want to hang out in a place where no one speaks French, the local Irish Pub has Guinness on tap. In Bouriege, there is a small cafe that can make small meals, coffee, etc.. However, anything else requires a trip to Limoux.

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  SPOUSE
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
   
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
  Can I bring my spouse/significant other? I will answer that with a few questions: Would you bring them on your usual club ride? Can they keep up with you? If so, please do bring them. If not, please leave them at home. Otherwise, they will be completely bored while you are out riding 4-8hr/day and because the rides are mostly unsupported, they is no way for them to join you. Because of the bedroom setup, couple must stay in Bouriege. The one double bed in Limoux is just too small.
</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  COSTS
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I'm looking at about $900 per person per room in Limoux and $1100 per person in Bouiege. Most of the beds in Bouriege are doubles, so if you want to bring your spouse, add $600 to bring them along (see spouse section above). Costs may change depending on the cost of the Euro, the cost of renting van, etc. I will firm these up shortly. I will include a commenerative cycling jersey in the cost so we all look the same on some of the mountain climbs. There will be options to also buy the bib shorts, arm warmers, etc.. The cost will also reflect the style of room selected and if there is someone else sharing the room (only one room in Bouriege is shared).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I will look after the house rental, <a title="Airport Transport" href="http://www.aerobus-hautevallee.com/" target="_blank">airport transport arrangements</a> to/from Limoux/Bouriege and be renting a van, everything else will be up to you. We will be collected from the airport by professional drivers with two vans.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Food costs are about $100-150 for two weeks if you eat in and at that rate, we are eating like kings. I will provide the basics for the kitchen such as milk, juice, fruit, pasta. You will be responsible for everything else. Will ride to the local market on Monday's, so you can buy fresh product, cheese, and other items.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  You need to place a $500 deposit by December 15 to hold your room. I will offer a $50 discount for anyone placing a deposit for bring someone else along (discount applies to the final deposit). Final deposit will be required by May 1, 2014. Once the costs are firmed up, all deposits are final. No refunds. Please buy travel insurance to cover the "in case you can't make it" possibility.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  GETTING THERE
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It cost me about $1200 for a return flight through AirFrance and $150 each way for the bike box. While you can rent bikes in Limoux, I would recommend against it. It will cost you the same to bring your own bike, and the bikes that are available are the ones you could buy locally in Toronto for $1000. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The flight was from Toronto to Paris and then Paris to Toulouse. If you think you can get a cheaper flight, be prepared to pay up to $300 each way for the bike box. Keep that in mind when booking your flight. You will need to show up at the airport within a small time window for the airport transfer to occur. Otherwise, you are on the hook for a 220EU cab ride out of your own pocket.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Booking the flight should be done in mid-January when Air France has a seat sale.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  For Paris, we will either fly into Paris from Toulouse and park out bikes at the Left Luggage at the airport, or ship out bikes back to Toronto and take the TGV train back to Paris from Carcasonne. I would like to take the train because it lands you in downtown Paris and the airport of 20km away. The bottom line is, I will recommend how we get to Paris. I will also be looking at what it would cost to ship the bikes back. Because we are doing two flights potentally (one from Toulouse-Paris and then one from Paris-Toronto), bikes can get expensive. It's also 60EU to leave a bike at airport for two days. So, it may be cheaper to ship the bikes back home from Limoux.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  While in Paris, you are responsible for your own accomodations. Why? Because after two weeks with the same group you might want to pay 800EU for a nice hotel room, or you might want to share an apartment with the group you came with to split the costs. I know from last year, everyone did their own thing when in Paris.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If it matters, I've been to the UK once and France some four times with my bike, so I have an idea of what to expect. I am sure there are other far more experienced, but if this would be your first time, you will be in good hands. This is a working vacation for me, so I will do my best to look after you.
</p>
