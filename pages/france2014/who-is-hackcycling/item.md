---title: Who is Hackcycling?visible: true---<p style="text-align: left;">
  I am a local cyclist in Toronto who enjoys riding and racing. I race on the road and on the track. I am regular and volunteer at the ForestCity Velodrome in London, ON and I am a member of cycling clubs such D'Ornellas Cycling and Morning Glory Cycling club. I have coached by Ed Veal (National Track Team member) and by Rob Good. I race on the road and on the track and commute via bike all year around. I like travelling to France as a vacation. Take in the sites and the local atmosphere. No pressure to ride hard or fast.

  I have experience travelling and riding in France. I've climbed Mount Ventoux (video: <a title="Mt. Ventoux ascent" href="https://vimeo.com/17435778" target="_blank">CLICK HERE</a>). I have been to Paris at least four times. I've been to England to ride. Last spring,  I lead rides in Brevard, NC at the Real Deal Training Camp. I organized and took a group of 14 people on this same trip in July 2012. I have arranged and run a training camp to Clemont, FL in March 2015.

  I am putting this trip together for few reasons:
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - to be able to offer others the change to ride in France and see the Tour in person who have the same passion I do for cycling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - to enable others to watch the Tour de France in person. This is a must for any cyclist.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  - to give people to ride in France on a budget - it does not need to cost $3000/week to have fun.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The goal of the trip is to break even and not make money. I do it because I like riding in the area in France. For me, this is as much a cycling vacation as a change to help others experience riding France.
