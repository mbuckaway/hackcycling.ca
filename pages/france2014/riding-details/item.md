  We will spend the two weeks riding the hills and mountains in the Limoux/Bouriege area. There will be a van used to shuttle from Bouriege to town. We will ride up the Mt. Venoux and to the beach as supported rides.
</p>

<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Mondays will be a short ride to Miropoix to sample the market where the van will wait for you to take anything your purchase back to houses.
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
  Wednesdays or Thursdays are long ride days. A support van will follow us to the Mediterranean or one of the long mountain passes.
</li>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There may a Rondo (Gran Fondo type) race in the area that we may be able to participate. If it is happening again, we will get some of the faster riders to compete.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This is a cycling vacation and not a race. We will ride in as a group waiting at the top of climbs for slower riders. Each ride stops at a cafe at the half-way point. After the cafe, if the faster riders want "hammer it home", they are welcome to do so as long as they can find their way. Stronger riders will also be encourages to challenge each other to get the KOM so long as they understand we ride as a group and waiting at the top of the climb is expected. Don't forget: some of the climbs are great for taking scenic photos!
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Rides will be led by Mark of Hackcycling who is familiar with most of the roads and cafe stops and another rider leader (TBD). TCX files will be provide and your Garmin loaded the previous night with the route for the next day. If you have a Garmin, you should buy the European maps as they will make navigating easier.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Rides at not supported. There will be no support vehicle other than the long rides days. However, were are never more than 40 kms away from a cafe, so water and food will be available. Two supported rides are included.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Temperatures in France in July range from 18-25C most days unless it gets really hot, where is can get up to 32C at the base of the mountains. At the top of the mountain passes, you can expect temperatures to range from 5C-20C depending on the weather at the top of the mountains. In 2012, for example, it was 20C at the top of a major climb because we had a clear day for the climb, but descended into the clouds where temperatures dropped to 10C rapidly.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Expect rides to be between 50-100km starting at 9AM and last to 4-8 hours depending on distance, the number of mountains/hills climbed, and the speed of the slowest rider. Rides in France just take longer because of the hills. If you were used to riding 90km in three hours here in Ontario, you can expect it to take 4-5 hours there. The average ride  is 90km.
