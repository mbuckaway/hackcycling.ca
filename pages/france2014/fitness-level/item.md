---title: Fitness Levelvisible: true---<p style="text-align: justify;">
  While the trip is a cycling vacation, there is a minimum fitness level required to ensure all participants enjoy themselves. We will ride as a group and wait for others at the top of climbs, but no one likes to stand at the top of a hill waiting too long for another rider. This trip is suitable for both intermediate and advanced riders who have group riding experience. This trip is about riding our bikes and relaxing after a ride.

  Bouriege is about 45km from the mountains. Limoux itself is on a river in a valley. What this means is that everything leaving Limoux is a climb. Bouriege is 12 km away from Limoux, and there is a nice climb up out of Limoux to get to this destination. Hills vary in grade from 1% to 14%. There are many great cycling routes and they are involve climbing and not just one climb, usually there are several.

  The trip is suitable for those who have experience with group rides, have done the Centurion 50 or 100 in Blue Mountain (or similar 100km Gran Fondo), can average at least 26-30km/h avg on flats roads, and can ride 40-80km between water stops. You should be capable of riding a 100km century ride without a support vehicle although the typical ride averages about 90km.  We stop at cafes for water/coffee but you should be capable of carrying things that you need. There will be two planned rides that will have a support vehicle. One will be a 100km ride to the Mediterranean Sea to work on your tan after the ride, and another will be to the Col de Pailheres (used in the Tour de France in 2013).

  You should know that riding a 90KM ride in France can take four to six hours depending on the amount of climbing but we will always stop at a cafe at the halfway point of a ride.

  This is not meant to scare anyone. If you have riding with a club for a few years, and are not afraid of climbing hills for an hour, you will fit in. However, you should have never had the thought of wanting to walk up (or down) a hill.

  For those with a higher fitness level and perhaps some racing experience, we can do the Buck loop and the 10 Hills Ride as fast paced training rides. You will be challenged to KOM/QOM every climb. The 10 Hills Ride has some 2500m of climbing over a 100km and finishes with a climb up the Limoux Wall: 800m at 14% average. It will test your fitness level and endurance. Typically, the Buck Loop, which can be done in just over an hour, is done after the morning group ride.

  There will be rides for everyone.
