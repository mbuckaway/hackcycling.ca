  We recommended Air France. This time we will be working with a travel agent to get a group rate. We make this recommendation based on the cost of the flight and cost of transporting your bike. While you can find cheaper flights, usually this means they charge a lot more for your bike box. You can take any airline you choose, but in order to be transported from the Toulouse airport to Limoux, you must be arrive and be ready to go by noon local time on Saturday, July 9. The airport shuttle we have arranged will only make one trip to the airport and it is about a 220EU cab ride to Limoux.

  It is important to book your bike box when you book your flight. Do not expect to be able to take your bike on the flight by showing up at the airport. With a large number of cyclists travelling, your bike make not make it there at the same time you do. At the very least, you MUST call the airline a minumum &nbsp;of a month in advance to book your bike onto the plane. Currently, cost of the bike box is $150 each way. Air France says you cannot pay for the bike box online, by that is not true. Pay for it as extra luggage, and usually they forget to charge extra for it when you get to the airport.

  We are looking at providing a group rate for flights. However, Air France requires a minimum of 10 people to offer the group rate. The current itinerary for flights and cost is as follows:
